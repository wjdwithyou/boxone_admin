5 | Perfect for dry, itchy skin | Veta60 | August 17, 2015
Pros: Easy To Use; Moisturizes; Good Value<br><br>I put this on after my bath and my skin looks and feels great.  I don&#39;t have Eczema, but do have a few areas of mild psoriasis that respond well to a little sun exposure everyday.  But I do find my skin tends to be dry and does itch if I don&#39;t pamper it.  Aveeno products help me do that.  I use their bath oil, shave cream, and this.  I&#39;ve been using their products for a while now and will continue to do so as  the improvement in my skin keeps me from feeling self conscious in an area of the country where flip flops, sleeveless tops, and shorts are your daily wardrobe.  I&#39;m 60 and my skin feels and looks better than it did 10-15 years ago when I was busy with work and just neglected it and wore long sleeves and long pants everyday.  I never though I would be comfortable out in public with sleeveless tops and shorts.  Thanks Aveeno!

5 | BEST MOISTURIZER EVER! | happycamper | May 2, 2015
Pros: Easy To Use; Fragrance free; Gentle; Moisturizes<br><br>Okay, so i never ever do reviews. But this had to be said. For about 2 years now I&#39;ve suffered from moderate to severe acne on my forehead, chin, and nose. Along with that, i have combination skin AND eczema on my face and arms. SMH! It was horrible. I mean red, itchy, bumpy, and everything made it worse. I&#39;ve tried everything over the counter, generic, cheap, expensive, you name the product and I have likely tried it. My doctor supplied me with steroids for my eczema, which helped stop the itching but somehow made me break out more. So long story short, I went online for about 3 days searching for a product that worked for acne and eczema. Now know that what works for me may not work for everyone and also I am not saying this product alone will cure acne. What I am saying is, this moisturizer is simply one of the best to keep your face and body moisturized without being too greasy. My face is smooth and soft and ACNE FREE. Here is what I did.<br><br>In the morning I wash my face with Panoxyl 10% BP (use the 4% if your skin is toooo sensitive). For this I just use a small dime size because alot goes a long way and plus its a foaming wash.<br>I then dry my face with a towel, apply the Aveeno Hydro Cortisone mixed with a dime size of the Aveeno Moisturizing Cream.<br>I repeat this again at night and WALLAH! In a week my face was COMPLETELY clear. I only had one or two pimple scars that I cleared with lemon &amp; tomato juice.<br><br>GET THIS PRODUCT!! for all skin types

5 | BEST ECZEMA TREATMENT OUT THERE | MelissaD | April 22, 2015
I have severe hand eczema and have tried everything. And I mean everything: prescription steroid ointments, Cortisone shot, coconut oil, vaseline, vinegar, etc. Nothing seemed to help. When I read the reviews of this cream, I was still skeptical but decided to give it a try. My first use was last night, and it was awesome. It felt so good when I put it on. It didn&#39;t burn either. When I woke up, my hands felt so good, smooth, and no itching. I put more on once I got to work, and I&#39;m loving this cream. I&#39;m hoping my eczema will go into remission soon. I know it&#39;s because I&#39;m under a lot of stress right now. I paid the same price for this cream as a prescription would have been , but I get a lot more in this cream and don&#39;t have to pay to see a doctor. To be honest, I&#39;d pay a lot more for this cream because it&#39;s that good and better for your body than any prescriptions. So if you&#39;re still skeptical, just give it a try.

Use this daily to remove makeup easily.

2 | Disappointed | JP | October 30, 2015
Pros: Smells Great; Not Greasy<br><br>Cons: No suds; Doesn&#39;t Absorb Well; Watery<br><br>My dermatologist gave me a few samples of this cleanser and I loved it.  Went onsite and order a full size bottle and it was like having a bottle of lightly scented water?  No foam, so I ended up adding some other body wash to it so I could feel clean. I had to look again to make sure I hadn&#39;t ordered the lotion by mistake, but no it was the cleanser.  Highly disappointed.  It was like someone had watered it down?

This is a great product for the price and also a great cheap dupe. Even though there is a bit of fall out with the product. Make sure you put something under the eye when applying as it goes onto the face. Apply shadow with a damp brush as it comes out as a stronger colour.

1 | Terrible | Disappointed | June 17, 2015
Cons: Wears Off Easily<br><br>This does not work as a clear coat. I did not use it over other polish, but as a clear coat, it flaked off the next day. It&#39;s very thin, so I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s a great top coat either. Not that shiny (shiny is a great top coat, by the way), and wore off so fast, leaving my nails looking terrible. I thought for the price it was going to be quality, but it was not.
review 2
5 | Best top coat | Pink | July 11, 2014
Pros: Good Value; Easy To Apply; High shine; Fast Drying<br><br>Really great top coat. Extremely high shine, similar to getting a gel manicure, without the hassle of trying to get gel nail polish off! The trick is to put on thinner layers. If you pile it on too thick, the top coat will adhere to the colored layers below, and it will make the entire polish easy to peel off (thicker layer, easier to peel off... makes sense). Again, I don&#39;t really have issues with polish shrinkage unless I put too thick of a layer on. Usually, after 5-10 minutes, my polish is dry and I can start using my hands to do regular tasks.

5 | The best! | shopqueen | August 17, 2015
Pros: Easy To Apply; Long Lasting; Good Value<br><br>Seche Vite is the gold standard in top coats. It&#39;s used in every nail salon I&#39;ve ever been to. When I do my own nails I always use this as a top coat. It needs to be used when the nails are still slightly wet with polish. It dries fast, the coat is very shiny, it smooths any imperfections in a manicure and makes a manicure last incredibly long.

4 | Motivates me to move | Moose and Squirrel | September 24, 2015
This replaced my Fitbit Charge (non HR) after its battery died prematurely.<br><br>There&#39;s two reasons to get something like this. One is if you need some motivation to move. I check my steps before lunch and when I get home from work. If the count is low, lunch includes a mile walk or the dogs get an extra long walk after work. The other reason is if you are doing Weight Watchers, and want your activity points automatically calculated. The Charge HR does a much better job with non-walking activities (bike riding, weight lifting) than the Charge or WW&#39;s old tracker did.<br><br>Pros: The fitbit smartphone software is fabulous. I wish every app was this stable and easy to use. The fitbit itself is stylish enough that I can wear it to fancy business things, but rugged enough that I don&#39;t worry about it when I&#39;m active. The alarms are fabulous -- the vibration is enough to get your attention, but not obnoxious enough to disturb others.<br><br>Cons: The Charge HR needs to be worn snugly, which means the clasp sometimes pinches or rubs, causing some irritation. The charging cord is very short, which means the watch is hanging in mid-air if you are charging from a wall outlet. The button on the Charge HR is too easily pressed just by moving your arm (did not have this problem with the Charge) -- this makes the battery life a bit shorter. I get about 3.5 days on a full charge, not the five claimed.<br><br>Summary: I would buy this again in a heartbeat. (Pun intended)

Good information on heart-rate, number of steps, etc., and tells the time. Easy to set up with online link to phone or computer to track daily progress for your age and weight. Not very comfortable oval shape on wrist, however that shape is needed to allow for skin contact. Best to purchase on sale. Black color is inconspicuous when worn to work.

Have tried several &quot;non-slip&quot; mats and this one is the best so far. The surface does scuff up easily compared to other mats, but it&#39;s a minor annoyance. The non-slip surface of the mat is just a thin layer however so we&#39;ll see how long it stays adhered to the rest of the mat. Like the design. Would like to see more color choices in the future.

5 | Awesome Mat | Snuffy01 | December 16, 2015
I love this mat for Hot Yoga. I used to use a thin non slip mat and a towel. This was a pain moving the towel and if the mat got wet I would slip. Also I had little protection as the mat was thin. I sweat allot and this mat takes care of the sweat and I have not slipped yet. (I am a slipper) I was at Hot Yoga and there were about 24 people in the class in a small room and it was really really hot. I was sweating like I had a faucet attached to me. The sweat started to gather on the mat and still I did not slip. The thickness is perfect as it protects my knees. I give this mat an 11 out of 10. The only issue I have is when the mat arrived it was rather scuffed up. This really disappointed me. I took pics and customer service did say they would replace the mat but I did not want to wait the week to ship to them and another week to get another one back. I wanted to keep using the SOL and I could not go back to the other mat even for 2 weeks.

Baby loves this, and I was able to transition form breast feeding to this really easy without any fuss. I love the fact that it has the DHA/ARA and its organic and no bad chemicals or bleach process.

Pros: Easy on Stomach; Easy To Swallow; Simple To Take; Tastes Good<br><br>I have GERD and take acid-reducers so I look for easily absorbed supplements.  This one fits the bill.

4.2 | Real surround from a giant sound bar | Matthew Moskovciak | March 24, 2015
The Good: The Vizio S5451w-C2 sound bar includes two rear speakers, allowing it to deliver a real surround sound experience from a sound bar system. The sound bar itself is jumbo-size, creating more stereo separation than traditional systems, and the plus-size sub creates more bass. It&#39;s also packed with features, including two HDMI inputs, Bluetooth, and a remote with a built-in display.<br><br>The Bad: Truly massive system, especially compared with other sound bars. The sound bar&#39;s height might block your TV&#39;s remote sensor. And you can get similar surround-sound effects from Vizio&#39;s smaller 5.1 sound bar for half the price.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Vizio S5451W-C2&#39;s extra-large sound bar and surround speakers deliver standout surround sound, if you can live with the size.

After doing extensive research, not only on quality but price of product and not to mention innovation, i decided to check out this Vizio 54.<br>I have.... excuse me had ...a Harman Kardon Sb26 aka($600.00 plus tax), and in a nutshell the vizio blew it out of the water.<br>I am so impressed with Vizio from their boxing and set up instructions, super easy!!! To the quality of a 5.1 for the soundbar category.<br><br>In &quot;laymans&quot; terms this thing is SICK OR TIGHT OR AWESOME!!<br><br>Get it!!! VIZIO is definitely headed in the correct direction...at this rate I expect good things. Any ways my favorite thing is the 5.1 with wireless sub... Granted the sb 26 had deeper bass (10 v 8) the fact that i can hook up 2 satellite speakers to the wireless subs is AMAZING...<br>Vizio has done something no one else has been able to...I won der if they know????<br><br>P.

4 | Rear speakers make this my go to sound bar | gnewengland | April 29, 2015
The rear speakers make this my sound bar of choice. I like that you don&#39;t have to rely on sound reflections to recreate surround sound... As with the majority of sound bar systems, I wish the subwoofer were more substantial. Vizio has several models for this line and this has the largest subwoofer (8&quot; driver) as well as an expanded bar (I believe the drivers are upgraded). Very easy to setup and at $499 ($399 on sale) is still a great value. There are systems with better bars and subwoofers (mostly more expensive) for sure - but none will give you the rear channel.<br><br>Can&#39;t compete with a true 5.1+ setup, but I think this is among the best compromises if you want great sound and surround effects without cluttering up the living room with wires. Adds great depth to the audio of a home theater and makes for a nice, clean, sleek setup!

3.2 | Not good, but good for the price if you're a Prime member | Xiomara Blanco | November 12, 2015
The Good: The Amazon Fire tablet definitely isn&#39;t overpriced. It runs a user-friendly operating system and houses a microSD card slot expandable up to 128GB. Amazon Prime members can access the bevy of free TV shows, movies and games included in the subscription.<br><br>The Bad: The design feels cheap. Performance is slow if many apps are open in the background and when downloading. The display has a low resolution and touchscreen response can be sluggish.

So far only 1 app has &quot;crashed&quot; on me resulting in a restart.<br><br>The size is perfect, almost fits in a man&#39;s jeans back pocket without a case, but large enough to enjoy looking at for extended periods.<br><br>Battery seems to hold up well, and the buttons are working as they should, with quick transitions and processing.<br><br>I added a 64GB SD card to store things later, but I never planned on using it for much more than an around the house browsing or streaming device.<br><br>The camera works well.<br><br>The sound is decent.<br><br>They make cases just like that of the Apple tablets for as little as 8 bucks.<br><br>Bottom line, it&#39;s not the best tablet, but it is a good one for someone who&#39;s never used one or just wants one for general purpose use. I would trust a device from Amazon a lot quicker then some of these cheaper tablets.<br><br>We bought 4 more to give away at Christmas we liked ours so much.

4 | all the OM-D you need in a small package | Mike Honey | March 12, 2014
This is a proper OM-D camera, cut down in size maybe, but not missing many features.  The wifi and focus peaking are new and very welcome additions.  The image quality is awesome and the autofocus is fast (just like with the previous OM-D models).  There are plenty of m4/3 lenses to choose from...  I am very happy with my purchase!  I can take DSLR-quality pictures with a camera that fits into a jacket pocket.<br><br>The cons are few.  As has no doubt been mentioned before, the menu system is needlessly complicated and is in bad need of an overhaul.  I also wish there was an easier way to set up and recall custom settings - why doesn&#39;t Olympus put C1, C2 on the mode dial like so many other manufacturers?<br><br>Other than that I can whole-heartedly recommend this amazing little camera.  Thanks Olympus for not deliberately crippling it like many other brands would have!

4 | Great camera, not perfect | gumby | February 17, 2015
Pros: Good dynamic range; Fast Focus; Lightweight; Awesome in low light; Responsive; Awesome Low Light<br><br>Cons: Just Slightly Too Small; Shutter Button Touchy; Grip Small For Weight; Grip Small For Lt Weight<br><br>I have 30+yrs of photog experience, starting with Olympus, then a couple Minoltas, then Nikon.  I shot slides when I wasn&#39;t developing and printing my own B&amp;W.  When I moved to digital, it was to a D80.  D80 was nice, but I was disappointed with low-light/long exposure abilities.  I switched to a Canon 50D and loved the pics, but I missed a lot of the nuances Nikon gave.  So I came back with the D750.  In the last couple months it&#39;s been a solid performer.  You can get way more specs and reviews elsewhere, so no point in my doing that... I&#39;ll just talk about my experience in case it helps anyone...<br><br>The camera is great to handle, but could be a bit bigger (not heavier, just bigger like my Canon 50D or the D8x0 or D7x0) - to manipulate controls, I often have to curl my fingers up a little vs. just resting them relaxed on the camera and slide around.  It just feels a little less stable doing that with this camera.  It feels just a tad too small for the weight with the kit 24-200mm lens, like if it was a hair bigger but the same weight, handling would be better.<br><br>Battery life is good.  Nearly no shutter lag.  Front AND rear IR sensors for IR remote.  2 custom setting banks, yeah!!  Ahhh, back to the good old Nikon controls.  FX is good for me b/c I want a wide FOV (landscapes, nature) and other times want shallow DOF (closeup nature).  But don&#39;t let FX hype get you - you might not get as much bang for your buck w/ FX as hype leads you to believe (ie D7100 = nice camera...)<br><br>Grip 1: I wish the AF points were spread more evenly throughout the viewfinder.  I work on tripod a lot and like to bounce the AF/metering point around checking spot metering and sometimes my focus area WITHOUT mucking around with the tripod.  The points are crammed in the middle of the screen adding annoyance to my shooting.  For instance, shooting a sunset from the mountains, as the light is changing, I like to bounce around taking metering from various spots - dark clouds, sun-lit clouds, foreground, edges, etc.  Also, sometimes in such a low-light scene I need a high-contrast area to focus on that&#39;s juuuust outside the AF area.  Sometimes I end up having to unlock ballhead, reposition direction, focus, flip to manual focus, re-compose, re-lock ballhead, and then finally take pic.  What a pain.  Liveview might take care of this issue for focus, but a) Im a dinosaur and like to look through my camera, and b)for longer exposure stuff, I don&#39;t want to burn my batteries up using LV the entire evening.<br><br>Grip 2:  The shutter button is soooo light it a) feels cheap, and b) it&#39;s hard to half-push to set focus/wake it up.  With eve LIGHT gloves on like I use when shooting in the snow, forget about being able to half-push it.<br><br>I like it, it&#39;s a good camera, and is loaded with awesome little features.  But part of me wishes I had gone up to the D8x0 line.  I don&#39;t need that resolution, have a hard time going beyond what the D750 costs, and frankly, the D750 eats up memory cards and HDDs fast enough shooting RAW.  The D750 has all the high-end features/function I want and the images are awesome, so a solid 4 stars.  It just does not FEEL like a high end camera to me.  For $3k kit price, it should feel better.  In some ways my D80 and Canon 50D both &quot;feel&quot; more solid, smooth, and refined which is sad b/c for price and features, should be stepping up.  If the D750 had just a bit better feel and the selectable AF points covered a little more of the frame, I&#39;d jump up and down and give it 5 stars.  Nah, I&#39;d be taking pictures with it right now instead of writing this long of a review...

4 | Great Lens, Questionable Quality Control | sy | September 3, 2012
Pros: Nice Bokeh; Strong Construction<br><br>Cons: Back focus; Focus shift<br><br>When I received my copy, it was a huge disappointment because it had strong back focus from f1.2 out of box. The lens this price range should have better quality control. Anyway I had to micro-adjust forward to -14 in order to focus properly. I&#39;ve read other reviews, and found out that some people had the same problem as I did. I guess it made me feel a little better knowing I&#39;m not the only one. I was aware of focus shift on this lens, and found out to be true. But it&#39;s not too critical for me.<br><br>At f1.2 images are reasonably sharp. It&#39; gets pretty sharp after post production sharpening. It gets sharper when stopped down. It sometimes creates heavy color fringes at f1.2, and it&#39;s more like ghosting. Also auto focus gets wacky at f1.2 time to time but this may be caused by camera&#39;s focus error (5D MkII in my case), or may be combination of both lens and camera.<br><br>In real life shooting, this lens produces fantastic images as I expected. Now the focus is adjusted, I enjoy playing with it. Portraits with wide aperture creates a certain atmosphere. It has very nice creamy bokeh and good color rendering.<br><br>I&#39;ve been using EF 50mm f1.8 Mark I. This is also one of my favorite lens I&#39;ve owned. Noisy (no USM) but very sharp and compact. In fact if you can find a good copy, I highly recommend it. So I had to think if f1.2L worth ten times more money than this little old lens. If you need wider aperture, better bokeh, strong typical L construction, or USM, then yes, probably so. But if you don&#39;t need them, I say probably not. But it surely gives you the satisfaction of owning one.

5 | Excelent lense for specialized usage | Film photography | March 1, 2014
Cons: Heavy<br><br>This is a specialized lense at f/1.2. My review is  for f/1.2, /1.4, /1.6 apertures. This lense is excellent at smaller apertures from f/5.0 to f/13.0 (smallest) but you are carrying a lot of high quality (heavy) L glass if you are only using those ranges. <br>At f/1.2 it shines most in face-to-face close portraiture photography or in creative 3D compositions with the main subject/object at 0.5 meter to 2.2 meter away and everything else out of focus. f/1.2 is not a good choice for scenes with props and objects around people or if you try to tell a story or document a situation or sports (DoF is very narrow, angle not wide, you cannot have more than one center of attention in your composition unless you close it down). The error most people make including myself initially is to think this is a low light lense that will extend their opportunities without changing their style. Once you set aperture to 1.2 it is a completely different animal and it suits a different type of photography.<br>Quality wise it is solid, well build and works perfectly. My only critic is I sometimes get pictures that I thought i nailed that come out slightly out of focus (back focus ? but i have a film camera). Half of those might be my fault as I shoot hand held (another mistake with this lense at 1.2). But I regularly get very sharp ones (although not razor sharp). That would be my only small grip if I had to name one. The value of this L lense is in getting an incredible artistic feel in the picture due to smoooth bouquet especially for facial portraiture where you want to capture mood of a person or appearance under a certain light it is insurpassable. f/1.2 and 50 mmm is a strange combination. It can lead you to make the &quot;wrong&quot; type of pictures that do not work (this has nothing to do with the lense quality but your understanding of the instrument). There is a button on the lense than when held pressed will hold the shutter down to whatever Av setting so you can see the actual DoF focus through the viewfinder ! This is a very useful trick if you are composing in broad daylight. When you get the lense I suggest you play with that before taking pictures so you develop an inner DoF eye for this lense.<br>Again to me this lense is extremely close to a perfect realisation of a 50mm f/2 design except for maybe not being dead-on absolutely razor sharp no question. I hope I situated this lense well for potential buyers as it seems to be a misunderstood spec combination. It is a huge potential for creative photographers and cannot be replaced by anything else in what it can do.

4 | Quality is amazing, but auto-focus slow | Charles F. | October 15, 2013
Pros: Rugged; Nice Bokeh; Strong Construction<br><br>Cons: Heavy; Slow Focus<br><br>I love the images that this lens produces.  The bokeh (blurred background) is incredible and maybe the best I&#39;ve ever seen from anything I&#39;ve used.   The problem however is the slowness of the auto-focus.  My main reason for buying this lens was to great photos of my daughter who is of toddler age.  The problem is that she moves around way too much for me to be able to capture the moments with this lens.<br><br>I sadly could not justify the cost of this lens over the 50mm f1.4 which is only a quarter of the cost.  Perhaps when my daughter (and future kids) get older I&#39;d be able to better utilize the 50 1.2L.

5 | Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick Review: Ranked on Best PC Joystick | Anonymous | June 30, 2015
Pretty much everything about this joystick is designed well and it&#39;s clear that it was created for easy gaming and PC general use. The stick itself is well-built, though it&#39;s obviously meant for a right-handed user. It has twist sensitivity, along with directional control, with a comfortable mold that lets you play longer and control things with great accuracy. The 12 buttons on it should be more than enough for most games, giving you options to program each one with simple commands or complex macros. This makes it easy for you to play with just the joystick, so you don&#39;t need a mouse or keyboard cluttering up your desk. There&#39;s even an 8-way hat switch that&#8217;s great for POV cockpit views and a small throttle controller for flight simulators. Finally, the trigger button is very sensitive, so you can easily fire rapidly or take your time to line up each shot. This is just a great overall device and Logitech covers it with an unbeatable three year warranty.

5 | Great flight stick for gamers and enthusiasts | MuchShamSuchWow | February 27, 2014
Pros: Simple to use, plug and play<br><br>Cons: May require further button mapping, no separate throttle knob, not left handed friendly<br><br>The Logitech joystick was an easy buy for based on its standard referral from numerous game developers. You just plug and play without having to worry about setting up button mapping (for most games). The lack of a separate throttle is annoying, but non-essential for what I play. Logitech my get a bad rap for their quality on occasion, but there is a sturdy feel to it and it does not come off my desk when I move it around. Overall my only gripe would be that it is not as comfortable for lefties like myself because of the hand grip. Other than that it is a definite buy.

I was looking for something pretty that wouldn&#39;t show under more sheer tops...this worked out great. I do wish they had a 40C or 40D...band size stops at 38. Also, since this color is soooo awesome...would love it if they had panties to match but couldn&#39;t find any and the sales lady said they really didn&#39;t have any that she knew of.

5 | My favorite kitchen tool | Lulu | November 29, 2015
I was hesitant to buy this - would it be too heavy, why is a Dutch oven better than my old pan, is a Le Creuset a better Dutch oven? - but I&#39;m thrilled with the results so far.<br><br>Is this heavy? Yes, it is heavy but not so much that i can&#39;t wash it. I have a traditional cast iron camping Dutch oven and skillet that are twice as heavy and difficult to lift and clean. And the high maintenance and needing to season them was a deterrent in using the cast iron kitchen tools so the enamel lining of this was a big draw also. Nothing sticks and it cleans up so easy!<br><br>I had to pick red - my favorite color - and it is &quot;fun&quot; to use and also pretty when it is out on the counter (it makes me happier when I cook). The durability and versatility of this Dutch oven lets me cook things in the oven or on the stove top; my old pan was only for the stove top. I simmered red sauce in it for 1.5 hours today without any scorching and the clean up was SO EASY. The enamel coat is a dream. i see why this is better than my old sauce pan.<br><br>And is it as good as a Le Creuset? I don&#39;t have a Le Creuset but this Dutch Oven appears to be the virtually the same. When I mentioned my conundrum between the Lodge Dutch Oven and Le Creuset to a local kitchen store, they wanted me to buy their Le Creuset they sold based on the only argument that Le Creuset is French and has a great reputation. Beyond that, I don&#39;t see the difference.<br><br>I recommend this in a heart beat. If I could, I&#39;d buy every color!

3.6 | Curved-screen fitness smartwatch one step short | Scott Stein | July 3, 2014
The Good: The Gear Fit has a forward-looking design, many more extras than the average fitness band, and the ability to measure heart rate. Its curved AMOLED display looks fantastic, too.<br><br>The Bad: The long display means text reads awkwardly on your wrist. The Fit only works with certain Samsung phones. Can&#8217;t load apps, so you&#8217;re stuck with the features included. And the price is high, so much so that you might consider a cheaper alternative or the same-priced, more full-featured Gear Neo.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Samsung Gear Fit is a great-looking wearable, but doesn&#39;t successfully reconcile its dual roles as activity tracker and smartwatch.

5 | Fantastic Product! | ScottM49 | November 28, 2015
I&#39;ve been using mobile technology since my very first &quot;bag phone&quot; many many years ago. I&#39;ve used so many different brands - until I came across Samsung with my first Galaxy S2 when it first came out... since then, I&#39;ve remained with Samsung due to their superior products and ease of use. This product is no different. I&#39;ve recently come to a point in my life where I&#39;ve decided I need to get back into shape, but oftentimes the &quot;motivation&quot; isn&#39;t there, or the results are skewed over such a long period of time that it&#39;s hard to really see progress. This has changed with the Gear Fit. With a great price-point, and a beautiful sleek design that is SO LIGHT you hardly even know it&#39;s there! This thing tracks my weight, my sleep, my heart-rate - and meshes so seamlessly with my S-Health on my Galaxy S6 that it is so easy to track my results, and thus plan accordingly. I&#39;ve now lost 10 pounds in less than a month, and I pretty much owe it all to this nifty little device and Samsung! Thanks guys!

5 | Works Great, but be patient with old stains | Innkeeper | May 1, 2015
As an innkeeper and mother of five I am constantly battling stains. It is very disheartening to see newly purchased expensive sheets and towels stained beyond saving after only a few days in circulation. I was glad to find Oxi Clean Max Force. I use it for stubborn stains that refuse to disappear after regular wash, pre-soaking with Oxi Clean Powder and manual wash. I first tried it out on a fairly new towel that was doomed to be discarded because after washing, soaking and re-washing the stain was still there. I was especially determined. I just purchased this high quality Egyptian cotton creamy-white towels and the very first week some were covered with yellow-brown stains that would not wash away. I sprayed a good portion of Max Force on, rubbed it in and let it sit for 6 hours. At first there was no change. I kept coming back every day, adding a few sprays onto the stain to keep it soaked and giving it a few rubs. On the seventh day I washed the towel and it was as good as new. I was so impressed I took all the other doomed sheets and towels and patiently gave them the same treatment. This time I kept them in a tub covered with plastic wrap so that Max Force wouldn&#39;t dry up and I would not need to reapply it as much. I saved so many of my precious Egyptian cotton sheets and towels from being thrown away that my time and Max Force&#39;s price are totally worth it. I only wish I could buy it in a larger bottle. I have been so happy with Oxi Clean products in general that I have a positive association with their smells.

I treated their clothes with this product (twice) and washed them (twice) and they are still stained!!! Huge waste of money and I will never buy it again. I ended up tossing a lot of shirts because I have been unable to find a product good enough to remove the stains.

1 | It Didn't Work | Disappointed | February 16, 2015
Bought this after carefully reading label, as it stated it would remove dried-in grease/oil stains. Followed the directions exactly. Well, it didn&#39;t work. Grease/oil stains still present and unchanged. Very disappointed after spending $$ for this.

Pros: Easy to Clean; Quick Installation; Stores Easily; Lightweight<br><br>Cons: Very Small Steps<br><br>This product was alot smaller than I expected but luckily I have a small dog.  The steps are very narrow but once he got the hang of it he did alright.  It serves the purpose but I would not recommend it for a medium or large dog at all.  Being plastic it cleans easy, folds up for easy storage and there was nothing to put together except the attach the carpet pads to the top of the steps and they were self-adhesive.

I have a tall bed and I didn&#39;t like my little pups jumping off, plus I had to pick them up and put them on the bed every time they wanted up.<br><br>These steps are tall, don&#39;t take up too much room and are sturdy. I did have a problem like I read in some of the reviews with the little sticker feet coming off. A quick fix with a little drop of E6000. I let it set up over night and WAHLA! They are perfect!<br><br>I also like it that they are easy to wipe down to keep clean and they fold up and slide under my bed or in the closet when I want them out of sight.<br><br>Well worth trying and they are a great price on the Bed, Bath and Beyond site!

5 | What A Deal! | Poomaw | March 31, 2015
Theses steps are very well made and lock easily into position upon unpacking. Even the pads on the steps are well made and easy to put apply. The little non skid nobs are kind of had to see when peeling off. I dropped one and it took awhile to find. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and the price was outstanding. My Maltese took right to these steps and doesn&#39;t have to wake us up from bed when he wants up or down.

4 | Dog Stairs | Mickalow | December 31, 2014
There stairs are very good for the price. I like the fact that they fold up and are light weight. I have a small dog, around 18 lbs, and he doesn&#39;t have any problem using the stairs, but he tends to go up them on the run. I think this is because the steps are not that wide, and he does not feel comfortable going up them one at a time. And, it just may be him, and would not be the same for other dogs.. Over-all, a good valuee.

5 | I'm tall, and it fits! | tallguy | December 29, 2015
Bought two of these in gray and black, size XLT. I&#39;m 6&#39;7&quot; 250lbs. Standing with good posture the sleeves end just above my knuckles, which is pretty much perfect. The jackets have room for me to wear an unsulated sweat jacket underneath, which is what I do, but arent to loose to wear alone. After reading some reviews, I see they have added an inside pocket, perfect size for an iphone with case. Other reviews mentioned issues with zippers. They are metal and have worked fine for me so far.

2 | Sizing is off | Changeling | January 13, 2016
We had to return these pants because they were sized incorrectly. My husband didn&#39;t want to replace them. They were at least 3&quot; to long and the were very baggy. Maybe it had the wrong tag. Levi&#39;s are usually reliable in their sizing. The idea of the pants sounds good with a bit of stretch. Women&#39;s pants have had it for a while now. Men should be comfortable too.

4 | Like the stretch | LeoZ | November 18, 2015
I&#39;m athletically built and I like the fact that they offer these jeans in odd sizes. I was able to get a 33 waist, which is usually hard to find. I really like the stretch material in these jeans and I&#39;ve also bought 505s and 541s with this same material. They fit snug but not tight and the material allows me a comfortable range of motion. The 514s are a little higher in the crotch than the others but they are still comfortable. The 514s are also snugger on my waist than the 505s and the 541s even though they are all waist size 33. I bought the 514s in black and they look great. I&#39;m glad they finally started making mens jeans in this material. I didn&#39;t give excellent ratings because I don&#39;t know how durable these are yet but I love them so far.

5 | Stunning Leather | kodya | December 3, 2015
The leather used on this bag is wonderful. I really like a soft leather as is used in this bag and the black color is lovely and neutral with the gold chain strap. The Mini Convertible Phoebe is bigger than it looks, especially the three inch wide middle compartment. The snap works quickly to secure everything. My concern is that the strap with chain is VERY heavy. It&#39;s actually heavier than the bag. The actual links on the chain are also quite big. I think this may be my preference as I was looking for a small bag and the total weight is more medium because of the chain (my husband agreed on the weight of the chain as I was questioning myself).. All in all, a great Kate Spade look. BTW, the &#39;Kate Spade New York&#39; emblem is so nice - studs instead of stamped. Nordstrom delivery, ordered online Saturday, was on Tuesday!

5 | Fabulous | MEMS | November 23, 2015
If you&#39;re looking for a small purse with lots of dividers/pockets, this is it! There is great organization potential but not lots of room so you have to want a small purse. The color is very rich and the style is lovely. It has room for a phone, wallet (7&quot; long), sunglasses, keys, and the extra incidentals like mints, lipstick, gum, etc. but not a big make-up case.

I typically don&#39;t go for smaller handbags, but the interior layout of this one makes it roomier than you might think. The 3 compartment organization along with pockets for your smartphone etc. give it the ability to hold quite a bit. Photos do not do this bag justice, the color and detailing are gorgeous in person. Love the convertible chain and the option to switch from a double chained shoulder bag to a single chain cross body when needed.

This is the ideal size for the essentials, wallet, phone, lipstick, brush with a bit of room to spare. The color is a gorgeous wine in person and the leather is deliciously soft while still holding it&#39;s shape. Overall, highly recommend. Seriously considering another color!

Most of the reviews stating that the product is a little loose in some areas are completely correct. There is some extra bunching around the knees. These really are more like pants and you could get away with not wearing another layer on top. Most people don&#39;t realize they are fleece when I wear mine and they are super warm. I like the high waist fit and agree that a draw string would be helpful. If you are handy though, you can install your own.

I ordered these as pants to wear in the house during the winter. They have been great for that --- so warm and comfy.They do stretch out though, which is fine for me cause I&#39;d rather have them be a little loose, but they definitely don&#39;t stay skin tight. I got a small, I&#39;m 5&#39; 5&quot; and 130lb and they fit great. I&#39;ll take these camping once winter is over, and I think they would work great as a nighttime layer as well in that capacity.

This is a great shirt though I feel I am in between sizes normally wearing a medium in UA tops.

I have this shirt in every color it comes in but this is the only site or store having this particular color. Nice and vibrant! This is lightweight but will really keep you warm!

5 | As the name implies- sexy sweatshirt! | Anonymous | January 18, 2014
I bought this sweatshirt almost a year ago and it has yet to see a week without wear. I bought the color in icicle green and it&#39;s a cool heather light green. I love the half zip- I only wish that the zipper went up farther in the neck. What can I say? I like my neck covered. I bought it in the size small and at 5&#39;8&quot; and 130 it was a good choice for me. The sleeves are perfect length (with much adored thumb holes) and it hits just below my hips. I like that because unlike a lot of Patagonia and Prana tops which are too short on me, this one from Lucy is great. After several washings, the sweatshirt shrank minimally, just just enough for a great fit. I wear this hoodie around the house, in town, and for it&#39;s intended purpose, to yoga class and back again. I also have another Lucy yoga top and feel the same about it. Good brand- worth the money, especially on sale! The cotton is soft yet durable. It seems to be double lined, with a tricot inner liner. The kangaroo pocket is clutch!

4 | Nice All-around Sweatshirt | Anonymous | December 19, 2013
I really like this sweatshirt, it&#39;s great for running errands, hiking, or just hanging out at the house. If you layer it with a thermal underneath it keeps you plenty warm. Or just a tank top for the fall, so I like that it is versatile. The only complaint that I have is that after washing and drying, it seemed to shrink up a bit, not too terrible but I liked it better prior to the wash. I would recommend air dying this one.

The rose gold tone is gorgeous and feminine, and the diamond marker is subtle and pretty and stands out beautifully against the shiny mirrored dial!

Great in every way, except one. The latch (the hook part), doesn&#39;t open fully. So hooking it around to put on or trying to get it unlatched isn&#39;t simple and quick. Takes me a few times. That&#39;s the only issue I have w/it. Went back to the counter and that&#39;s how they&#39;re all made.

I purchased this watch just today! Been looking for one that would go with all jewelry. Meaning I can wear all colors because this watch is a combination of rose gold, black and silver! (It was really hard to purchase today because I was Christmas shopping for OTHERS and YES...I felt guilty buying for myself.

5 | Very pleased | Nichole88 | October 28, 2015
I bought this a few days ago and just received it today. I am very happy with it. The smaller size and stones around the edge give it an elegant feel. I also like the stones in the face of the watch. The Acetate has a cool look to it.

5 | Super Pretty | lycheedai | September 14, 2014
The rose gold looks young and classic. The watch size is good for professional look and I also like the different colors of diamonds on the dail. Got so many complements from it.

5 | stunning to all | kcali | April 23, 2014
This is such a beautiful watch, I notice when I wear it, people men and women can&#39;t stop staring at it.<br>It looks really classy for dress and casual.<br>I am a devotee of rose gold, so I chose that one. The stones around the face of the timepiece set it off with subtle pop.<br>I love this watch I am thinking of getting it in the yellow gold also. Great purchase.

5 | Worth it!! | Charx23 | October 9, 2013
I&#39;m in love! This watch is well worth splashing out on as its classic and beautiful-everyone&#39;s always commenting on it! Does come up large but is easily altered if you go to a jeweller/watch shop. Arrived beautifully packaged in 2 days too! Highly recommend it!

4 | Nice Gift for Baby &amp; Mommy | Beth the first time mom | July 27, 2015
Pros: Pretty Gift Set; Great Smelling Products<br><br>Cons: A little expensive<br><br>I bought this product because of the sale they were having (buy 2, 1 one free).  I&#39;m so glad I chose this gift set because it&#39;s for both baby and mommy.  I love the smell of the products and the presentation of the set was done nicely.

5 | His Favorite | Mommy times 2 | January 2, 2016
Pros: Quality Construction; Good Value; Lightweight; Durable; Easy To Use<br><br>This is my son&#39;s favorite Christmas present. The touch screen makes it easy for him as a 9 month old to interact with the phone. The sound isn&#39;t too loud, but it is loud enough that it grabs his attentions. <br><br>The size is perfect for his hands. The function of the sliding screen is something he can figure out how to use as he gets older. It&#39;s great when we are riding in the car and I hear him playing with it almost the entire ride.

4 | I would recomond this product | Happy Mommy | September 2, 2015
Pros: Durable; Easy To Use; Quality Construction; Good Value<br><br>My five month old daughter loves this toy.  It occupies her time, while teaching her.  This product is great beacuse it is similar to my phone with the apps, but fun and safe for her to use.  One thing that I dis like is there is no volume, so if we are out in public the volume is too low and my daughter can not hear it so she will lose interest.

4 | So Much Fun!! | jalequin1 | August 5, 2015
Pros: Easy To Clean; Easy To Use; Good Value<br><br>This is a very easy to use item! Our 13 month old gets a kick out of this. She loves to play with our phones so when we saw this we knew she&#39;d love it. It&#39;s just the right size for babys little hands and it will keep them entertained for quite a while.

5 | Wonderful to use at Restaurants! | MichelleS | July 10, 2015
This is a perfect alternative for your toddler if they are not yet using bowls or plates. We&#39;ve been using these for months since our daughter started finger foods. They are super portable and clean up is a breeze!

5 | amazing! | Kristin | June 20, 2015
Just bought these last weekend and I love them! The baby gets to eat on a clean surface and the restaurant doesn&#39;t have a huge mess to clean up. Will continue buying then and telling friends and family!

Warning - this product does not come packaged as it appears in three 20 count bags. It comes in one 60 count bag. I bought this to use in three different baby shower gifts, so when I had to repackage it myself (which feels a little cheap to me).

4 | Desitin Maximum Strength Original Paste Review: Ranked on Best Diaper Rash Cream | Anonymous | September 25, 2013
Recommended by both pediatricians and parents, Desitin Maximum Strength Original Paste made this list because of its potent rash-fighting ingredients. Desitin offers the highest concentration of zinc oxide youll find in a diaper cream, which makes it an effective product for even severe diaper rashes. Parents say this is one of the thickest creams on the market. While some parents say this can make it somewhat difficult to apply, most moms say it forms an effective barrier and offers superior protection for babys delicate skin.

4.8 | Burtand#039;s Bees Baby Bee Shampoo and Wash Review: Ranked on Best Baby Shampoo | Anonymous | January 14, 2014
Burts Bees has been creating good-for-the-body (and the earth!) products for more than 25 years, and the Baby Bee line of shampoos and soaps has quickly become a favorite among parents who prefer to take a more natural approach to bath time. This hypoallergenic shampoo is 98.9 percent natural, so its gentle on babys skin. Whats more, this sulfate-free shampoo creates a nice lather, and can also be used as a body wash and bubble bath. In addition to being one of the more affordable natural shampoos out there, reviewers say its also one of the best-smelling.

Pros: Pleasant Smell; Easy To Use<br><br>As a family we use natural and organic products whenever possible.  This is no exception.  Made by a quality company with a sound reputation.  We have been using this product for over 4 years and my son has never complained even when the soap hits the eyes (which it is bound to do every now and again).

5 | Car still clean | Dkm | November 12, 2015
I have a Chrysler 300 and it was a bit too wide to fit in the middle but completely covers the other seats. No matter what has been spilled the seat protector has prevented it from getting in the cracks and crevices in the car. Easy to install. The only thing that could be better is the pockets. They are not going to hold much other than small toys.

3 | Great but it needs a strap... | RMK | September 15, 2015
This is a great enough product that I didn&#39;t want to return it. The quality is almost perfect and it was very easy to clean. The only thing I would recommend is for it to have a strap to hold the entire back up against the seat when the car seat is not on it. Other than that, the quality is great and it&#39;s a good buy.

5 | Perfect for both toddler and infant seats | Jroth0523 | July 27, 2015
The aid at Buy Buy Baby told me this is the only seat protector worth getting. I&#39;m extremely happy with my purchase. It protects my leather seats perfectly for both my toddler and infant car seats. The pockets that hang below are an added bonus. Def recommend.

4 | Pluses and minuses | New mom | March 27, 2015
Pros: Colorful and Fun; Easy to Wash; Easy to Grip<br><br>Cons: Hard Plastic<br><br>My 3 month old enjoys this toy. It is designed to be held easily by small hands. It is the only rattle I found that was the right size for a small hand. In the 2 weeks that we have had it my son has improved his ability to grasp it on his own and shake it. He loves the sound and shakes it a lot. Unfortunately it is very hard plastic so when he gets excited and shakes it he hits himself and cries because it hurts. I wish I could find a soft rattle that he could grab easily and makes loud noise ( wrist rattles are not loud enough to keep his interest).

5 | Great Toy! | Sarah A | July 20, 2015
Pros: Durable; Easy to Grip; Colorful and Fun<br><br>My 3.5 month old son LOVES this rattle, it is by far his favorite toy right now. His eyes light up whenever I pull it out and stay lit up as he shakes it and chimps on it. Great toy for a great price. Only downside it that if you need to wipe it down you have to make sure the cloth isn&#39;t too wet or water gets into the cylinder which is a mold risk.

5 | Love it! | Jmom5 | November 1, 2015
I bought this for my baby&#39;s room after having a crane elephant humidifier. The crane was harder to clean and seemed to get moldy even with daily emptying. This humidifier is awesome! I can go a couple of days before emptying it and it doesn&#39;t get gross. It is compact and light weight. The only bad part of it being light weight is that you can&#39;t flip the power switch with one hand, which isn&#39;t that big of a deal. I love that I can turn the top of it to have the mist spray two ways to cover more of the room. Would buy again for sure!

I have tried several brands of these, but this is my most favorite one! My grandchildren love them, too, but I think their grandmother likes them possibly even better than they do! These are wonderful for a snack after gardening for a few hours. Nice serving of potassium in each one, and other good stuff that really gives me a lift. I am so glad that Vitacost is stocking them now!!

I brought the Pear &amp; Apple and the Mango, Banana &amp; Orange on a recent camping trip-- for myself. They were a delicious bit of fruit during the week, and were just the right amount. I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have kids to fight me for these-- they&#39;re delicious! I also had the Carrot, Squash &amp; Apple, which was just fruity enough to still be a delicious little smoothy-ish treat, but you could still taste a hint of the root veggies.

I&#39;m an adult woman who usually wears a size 12. I bought this in XL &amp; it fit perfectly. The material of this dress is of better quality. The top is a stretch knit &amp; the bottom is woven material that isn&#39;t shiny. The skirt also has a lining &amp; a back zipper. This is a go-to dress that looks really cute with a belt.<br><br>I ordered the navy &amp; the black. I returned the black because the coral-y color is really bright &amp; leans orange. Overall though, you cannot beat this dress at this price.

Can&#39;t begin to count the number of primers I&#39;ve tried. Have paid $30 for some. Ran across this one when researching primers and decided to try it. Viola! There was my perfect primer.

3 | Not for oily people | Lindy | January 6, 2016
My first impressions of this primer when wearing it a few times now under my BB cream is that it is very slick. It has a very silicone-y feel to it. I can easily see oily people hating this because of the fact that is goes on super slick. I would image this would feel very greasy on an oily person. I have dry to combo skin and even the slickness of this is almost too much for me. I will say however, that it does a very good job of filling in my pores and creating a very smooth like finish to my face. For the price this is a very decent primer and I am pleasantly surprised with the results.<br>Just be careful because one full pump is far too much for the entire face.

5 | NARS Powder Blush Review: Ranked on Best Powder Blush | Anonymous | December 17, 2013
With so many options to choose from, anyone can find the perfect color for them. The blushes are perfect for both warm and cool-toned complexions. Girls who like shimmer can find several options, as can those who prefer a matte finish to their cheeks. And although the colors may look intense in the package, it is easy to apply them in a way that gives a natural flush. They are long-lasting and never look chalky.

One dab and one sweep, bam.<br>&quot;Orgas m&quot; is an award winning classic. The gold shimmer looks good on any skin tone.<br>&quot;Deep Throat&quot; is amazing too! I have a back up of this one just in case!<br>&quot;Se x Fantasy&quot; is very natural looking.<br>&quot;Albatross&quot; is a very nice highlighter to go on the tops of your cheek bones on any of these colours.<br>&quot;Gaiety&quot; is a nice light pink and build able depending on the look you are going for.<br>&quot;Laguna&quot; I got in the Holiday limited edition pack and you get a bigger size in that one than the single ones.

5 | Nars Orgasm Blush | SmellyCharlie | November 25, 2015
I have pretty pale skin, and I like how this blush doesn&#39;t look overly pink and how it has the right amount of shimmer. Love the look and size of the packaging. My go-to every-day blush.

4 | Nice color, could have better packaging | sourpeaches | October 31, 2015
I too got this for my birthday gift and repurchased as the full size. I love the rikugien color as an every day medium pink, but for the price I was expecting a twist up lipstick like all the other brands have been doing. I did not expect to need to sharpen this product and watch bits of the product get sharpened off.

5 | Great everyday color | CarlyU | August 14, 2015
Goes on smoothly, stays on well, and is a great everyday color. I wear it most days at work and reapply a few times throughout the day. Easy to apply without a mirror because of the slim size.

2 | Love the product, hate having to sharpen | lsands22 | June 29, 2015
I received this product as a sample with my birthday gift from Sephora and fell in love!! So much so that I bought a full size. It goes on smooth and feels wonderful, perfect amount of shimmer and sheerness while still giving me noticeable colour.<br><br>The problem: you have to sharpen the pencil. I was expecting a twist up, especially for $30+ and am extremely disappointed. Having to carry a pencil sharpener and deal with the mess is annoying and inconvenient. I have tried to match the colour in a lipstick by nars...and then by any other manufacturer and have been unable to find something just right...<br><br>Nars - please make these pencils a twist up and not a sharpen.

4 | Would have been 5 Star if full sized | prussia | May 8, 2014
I already own one multiple and I enjoyed the ease of use and convenience of the stick color, but I wanted a matte shade. Finally Nars has released multiples that are matte!<br><br>These are half the size of a normal multiple and the same price. I don&#8217;t like that because there are many color sticks that are far far less costly. Also my package is now fraying around the edges, it is like the matte black packaging is peeling off! (It has only been about 4 months with this) Yakh!!<br><br>I bought the color Anguilla this is described as a ginger pink and I view it as more of a cool toned pink with a hint of orange. I love this as a blush because it is creamy but not so much that it is slippery. It is pigmented enough that you get a nice color payoff and it can&#8217;t be overdone. I enjoy this as a lip product but you need to have moisturized lips to make these work, because they are dry, and will emphasize dry patches. (hence why I do not have a picture that includes it on my lips!)<br><br>I really enjoy the texture of this stick because it is not sticky, greasy or shiny. I am thinking about buying more, but because there are so many options for cheaper color sticks I will have to pass.

4 | Review: Matte Multiple | soleita | August 31, 2014
Bought Altai for cream contouring and I love it!<br>I use a Sephora #75 brush. It remains blendable for a couple of minutes, so you don&#8217;t have to feel too rushed. Wears for about 8 hrs. The texture feels silicone-like, almost velvety, light to medium weight, and smooth.<br>The only drawback is the price and cost of course.

5 | It's great! | CupcakeKitty | May 19, 2014
I got it in Altai and I use it to contour my face along with my Luxor multiple to highlight. It&#39;s very easy to blend with your fingers. Altai looks very natural on my fair/light skin tone&#8212; I wanted to get Vientiane at first but that looks way to orange when I swatched it on my hand in store. (I think Vientiane will look nice on gals with olive/darker skin tones) It lasts around five hours on my normal/combination skin. Only wish it could come in the same size as their original multiples, though.

It was exactly what I was hoping for, but the tounge is attached with the sides near your ankle which is different from most shoes so if your foot is wide or fat like mine itll take a few more seconds to put the shoes on but its possible and is still true to the size I was looking for.

I have two different pairs of nike air huarache and i love them.... But i received these navy camo ones as a gift from a friend and they were ordered online . The pair that was sent were oddly shaped in the front and felt cheaply made compared to the other two pairs of air huarache I own . I guess the only pro is that the color wasnt different than what the pic shows online. i recommend going to purchase these shoes in store .

I purchased this adorable bag in the &quot;port&quot; color because it reminds me so much of the Philip Lim mini Pashli at a fraction of the cost. This is the ideal size for the essentials, wallet, phone, lipstick, brush with a bit of room to spare. The color is a gorgeous wine in person and the leather is deliciously soft while still holding it&#39;s shape. Overall, highly recommend. Seriously considering another color!

5 | Perfect for dry, itchy skin | Veta60 | August 17, 2015
Pros: Easy To Use; Moisturizes; Good Value<br><br>I put this on after my bath and my skin looks and feels great.  I don&#39;t have Eczema, but do have a few areas of mild psoriasis that respond well to a little sun exposure everyday.  But I do find my skin tends to be dry and does itch if I don&#39;t pamper it.  Aveeno products help me do that.  I use their bath oil, shave cream, and this.  I&#39;ve been using their products for a while now and will continue to do so as  the improvement in my skin keeps me from feeling self conscious in an area of the country where flip flops, sleeveless tops, and shorts are your daily wardrobe.  I&#39;m 60 and my skin feels and looks better than it did 10-15 years ago when I was busy with work and just neglected it and wore long sleeves and long pants everyday.  I never though I would be comfortable out in public with sleeveless tops and shorts.  Thanks Aveeno!

5 | BEST MOISTURIZER EVER! | happycamper | May 2, 2015
Pros: Easy To Use; Fragrance free; Gentle; Moisturizes<br><br>Okay, so i never ever do reviews. But this had to be said. For about 2 years now I&#39;ve suffered from moderate to severe acne on my forehead, chin, and nose. Along with that, i have combination skin AND eczema on my face and arms. SMH! It was horrible. I mean red, itchy, bumpy, and everything made it worse. I&#39;ve tried everything over the counter, generic, cheap, expensive, you name the product and I have likely tried it. My doctor supplied me with steroids for my eczema, which helped stop the itching but somehow made me break out more. So long story short, I went online for about 3 days searching for a product that worked for acne and eczema. Now know that what works for me may not work for everyone and also I am not saying this product alone will cure acne. What I am saying is, this moisturizer is simply one of the best to keep your face and body moisturized without being too greasy. My face is smooth and soft and ACNE FREE. Here is what I did.<br><br>In the morning I wash my face with Panoxyl 10% BP (use the 4% if your skin is toooo sensitive). For this I just use a small dime size because alot goes a long way and plus its a foaming wash.<br>I then dry my face with a towel, apply the Aveeno Hydro Cortisone mixed with a dime size of the Aveeno Moisturizing Cream.<br>I repeat this again at night and WALLAH! In a week my face was COMPLETELY clear. I only had one or two pimple scars that I cleared with lemon &amp; tomato juice.<br><br>GET THIS PRODUCT!! for all skin types

5 | BEST ECZEMA TREATMENT OUT THERE | MelissaD | April 22, 2015
I have severe hand eczema and have tried everything. And I mean everything: prescription steroid ointments, Cortisone shot, coconut oil, vaseline, vinegar, etc. Nothing seemed to help. When I read the reviews of this cream, I was still skeptical but decided to give it a try. My first use was last night, and it was awesome. It felt so good when I put it on. It didn&#39;t burn either. When I woke up, my hands felt so good, smooth, and no itching. I put more on once I got to work, and I&#39;m loving this cream. I&#39;m hoping my eczema will go into remission soon. I know it&#39;s because I&#39;m under a lot of stress right now. I paid the same price for this cream as a prescription would have been , but I get a lot more in this cream and don&#39;t have to pay to see a doctor. To be honest, I&#39;d pay a lot more for this cream because it&#39;s that good and better for your body than any prescriptions. So if you&#39;re still skeptical, just give it a try.

1 | Terrible | Disappointed | June 17, 2015
Cons: Wears Off Easily<br><br>This does not work as a clear coat. I did not use it over other polish, but as a clear coat, it flaked off the next day. It&#39;s very thin, so I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s a great top coat either. Not that shiny (shiny is a great top coat, by the way), and wore off so fast, leaving my nails looking terrible. I thought for the price it was going to be quality, but it was not.

5 | Best top coat | Pink | July 11, 2014
Pros: Good Value; Easy To Apply; High shine; Fast Drying<br><br>Really great top coat. Extremely high shine, similar to getting a gel manicure, without the hassle of trying to get gel nail polish off! The trick is to put on thinner layers. If you pile it on too thick, the top coat will adhere to the colored layers below, and it will make the entire polish easy to peel off (thicker layer, easier to peel off... makes sense). Again, I don&#39;t really have issues with polish shrinkage unless I put too thick of a layer on. Usually, after 5-10 minutes, my polish is dry and I can start using my hands to do regular tasks.

5 | The best! | shopqueen | August 17, 2015
Pros: Easy To Apply; Long Lasting; Good Value<br><br>Seche Vite is the gold standard in top coats. It&#39;s used in every nail salon I&#39;ve ever been to. When I do my own nails I always use this as a top coat. It needs to be used when the nails are still slightly wet with polish. It dries fast, the coat is very shiny, it smooths any imperfections in a manicure and makes a manicure last incredibly long.

4 | Motivates me to move | Moose and Squirrel | September 24, 2015
This replaced my Fitbit Charge (non HR) after its battery died prematurely.<br><br>There&#39;s two reasons to get something like this. One is if you need some motivation to move. I check my steps before lunch and when I get home from work. If the count is low, lunch includes a mile walk or the dogs get an extra long walk after work. The other reason is if you are doing Weight Watchers, and want your activity points automatically calculated. The Charge HR does a much better job with non-walking activities (bike riding, weight lifting) than the Charge or WW&#39;s old tracker did.<br><br>Pros: The fitbit smartphone software is fabulous. I wish every app was this stable and easy to use. The fitbit itself is stylish enough that I can wear it to fancy business things, but rugged enough that I don&#39;t worry about it when I&#39;m active. The alarms are fabulous -- the vibration is enough to get your attention, but not obnoxious enough to disturb others.<br><br>Cons: The Charge HR needs to be worn snugly, which means the clasp sometimes pinches or rubs, causing some irritation. The charging cord is very short, which means the watch is hanging in mid-air if you are charging from a wall outlet. The button on the Charge HR is too easily pressed just by moving your arm (did not have this problem with the Charge) -- this makes the battery life a bit shorter. I get about 3.5 days on a full charge, not the five claimed.<br><br>Summary: I would buy this again in a heartbeat. (Pun intended)

Have tried several &quot;non-slip&quot; mats and this one is the best so far. The surface does scuff up easily compared to other mats, but it&#39;s a minor annoyance. The non-slip surface of the mat is just a thin layer however so we&#39;ll see how long it stays adhered to the rest of the mat. Like the design. Would like to see more color choices in the future.

5 | Awesome Mat | Snuffy01 | December 16, 2015
I love this mat for Hot Yoga. I used to use a thin non slip mat and a towel. This was a pain moving the towel and if the mat got wet I would slip. Also I had little protection as the mat was thin. I sweat allot and this mat takes care of the sweat and I have not slipped yet. (I am a slipper) I was at Hot Yoga and there were about 24 people in the class in a small room and it was really really hot. I was sweating like I had a faucet attached to me. The sweat started to gather on the mat and still I did not slip. The thickness is perfect as it protects my knees. I give this mat an 11 out of 10. The only issue I have is when the mat arrived it was rather scuffed up. This really disappointed me. I took pics and customer service did say they would replace the mat but I did not want to wait the week to ship to them and another week to get another one back. I wanted to keep using the SOL and I could not go back to the other mat even for 2 weeks.

4.2 | Real surround from a giant sound bar | Matthew Moskovciak | March 24, 2015
The Good: The Vizio S5451w-C2 sound bar includes two rear speakers, allowing it to deliver a real surround sound experience from a sound bar system. The sound bar itself is jumbo-size, creating more stereo separation than traditional systems, and the plus-size sub creates more bass. It&#39;s also packed with features, including two HDMI inputs, Bluetooth, and a remote with a built-in display.<br><br>The Bad: Truly massive system, especially compared with other sound bars. The sound bar&#39;s height might block your TV&#39;s remote sensor. And you can get similar surround-sound effects from Vizio&#39;s smaller 5.1 sound bar for half the price.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Vizio S5451W-C2&#39;s extra-large sound bar and surround speakers deliver standout surround sound, if you can live with the size.

VIZIO is definitely headed in the correct direction...at this rate I expect good things. Any ways my favorite thing is the 5.1 with wireless sub...

4 | Rear speakers make this my go to sound bar | gnewengland | April 29, 2015
The rear speakers make this my sound bar of choice. I like that you don&#39;t have to rely on sound reflections to recreate surround sound... As with the majority of sound bar systems, I wish the subwoofer were more substantial. Vizio has several models for this line and this has the largest subwoofer (8&quot; driver) as well as an expanded bar (I believe the drivers are upgraded). Very easy to setup and at $499 ($399 on sale) is still a great value. There are systems with better bars and subwoofers (mostly more expensive) for sure - but none will give you the rear channel.<br><br>Can&#39;t compete with a true 5.1+ setup, but I think this is among the best compromises if you want great sound and surround effects without cluttering up the living room with wires. Adds great depth to the audio of a home theater and makes for a nice, clean, sleek setup!

4.6 | Asus Zenbook UX305CA review | Matt Smith | November 19, 2015
The Zenbook UX305 is the latest cutting-edge ultrabook from Asus. It reinforces the brand&#8217;s affordable appeal, but can it defeat heavyweights like the Dell XPS 13 and Samsung ATIV Book 9?<br><br>Pros: Featherweight and super slim, Outstanding keyboard, High contrast, glare-free 1080p display, Very affordable<br><br>Cons: Modest performance

4 | Great computer, very light, thin , and fast!! | Taco | September 2, 2015
This computer is great, it&#39;s fast and very portable because it is so light and thin. The screen looks great and it has good battery life. The sleek design not only looks sharp, but is very convenient as well when carrying it. If I had to say anything about it, is that it doesn&#39;t have a backlit keyboard. This is worth the buy if your looking for a portable, speed demon of a machine.

This is one really good laptop. The price was really good, and I am highly satisfied with it. The battery is awesome, even on wifi. It is fast and has a really good boot up time. I got it for typing, and it does very well, even though I do not have internet at home. Decent amount of apps. Love it!

I bought this chromebook for my sister-in-law who is starting a web based business. She is a busy mom always on the go and this gives her web access and computing power to do business on the go. I was pleased with the service at Office Depot when purchasing this. From what I understand she is pleased with the size, portability, and battery life of this device.

My hubby only gets on FB and his hunting &amp; fishing forums. He wanted something that wasn&#39;t taking up space on his end table but with a screen he could see. Tablets just were too small - this is perfect! He likes the keyboard and screen size is good. So far no problem with battery life - can keep it plugged in if necessary ;) Great buy for what we need it for!

3.2 | Not good, but good for the price if you're a Prime member | Xiomara Blanco | November 12, 2015
The Good: The Amazon Fire tablet definitely isn&#39;t overpriced. It runs a user-friendly operating system and houses a microSD card slot expandable up to 128GB. Amazon Prime members can access the bevy of free TV shows, movies and games included in the subscription.<br><br>The Bad: The design feels cheap. Performance is slow if many apps are open in the background and when downloading. The display has a low resolution and touchscreen response can be sluggish. Gaming performance for large games is slow and the graphics can experience frame rate drops.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Amazon Fire is a fine tablet for casual use, but it&#39;s not a good tablet, it&#39;s just good for the price.

Pros: Amazon backs this tablet with comprehensive support and a one-year warranty.<br><br>Cons: Low benchmark scoring shows performance slows down when multiple apps are running.<br><br>The Verdict: The Amazon Fire is a lightweight, compact, entry-level tablet that may not meet the performance demands of power users.

4 | Good entry level tablet! | Applehatersux | December 11, 2015
I read mixed reviews on these tablets and nearly talked myself out of buying one, but then on Black Friday the price hit 35 bucks temporarily, so I bought it.<br><br>I am really happy that I did.<br><br>While it&#39;s no where near that of the Apple devices in overall image quality, it puts out a pretty nice screen view with plenty of color and brightness.<br><br>I was able to download all the main social media apps, several streaming content apps, and plenty of games to mess around with all for free. So far only 1 app has &quot;crashed&quot; on me resulting in a restart.<br><br>The size is perfect, almost fits in a man&#39;s jeans back pocket without a case, but large enough to enjoy looking at for extended periods.<br><br>Battery seems to hold up well, and the buttons are working as they should, with quick transitions and processing.<br><br>I added a 64GB SD card to store things later, but I never planned on using it for much more than an around the house browsing or streaming device.<br><br>The camera works well.<br><br>The sound is decent.<br><br>They make cases just like that of the Apple tablets for as little as 8 bucks.<br><br>Bottom line, it&#39;s not the best tablet, but it is a good one for someone who&#39;s never used one or just wants one for general purpose use. I would trust a device from Amazon a lot quicker then some of these cheaper tablets.<br><br>We bought 4 more to give away at Christmas we liked ours so much.

I got this camera as a gift for my wife and she&#39;s enjoyed it so far. We&#39;ve only had it for a month now, and the only downside we can see is the performance in low light. But for the conditions under which we will be using this camera, it&#39;s the right blend of stylishness, quality and portability.

4 | all the OM-D you need in a small package | Mike Honey | March 12, 2014
This is a proper OM-D camera, cut down in size maybe, but not missing many features.  The wifi and focus peaking are new and very welcome additions.  The image quality is awesome and the autofocus is fast (just like with the previous OM-D models).  There are plenty of m4/3 lenses to choose from...  I am very happy with my purchase!  I can take DSLR-quality pictures with a camera that fits into a jacket pocket.<br><br>The cons are few.  As has no doubt been mentioned before, the menu system is needlessly complicated and is in bad need of an overhaul.  I also wish there was an easier way to set up and recall custom settings - why doesn&#39;t Olympus put C1, C2 on the mode dial like so many other manufacturers?<br><br>Other than that I can whole-heartedly recommend this amazing little camera.  Thanks Olympus for not deliberately crippling it like many other brands would have!

4 | Great camera, not perfect | gumby | February 17, 2015
Pros: Good dynamic range; Fast Focus; Lightweight; Awesome in low light; Responsive; Awesome Low Light<br><br>Cons: Just Slightly Too Small; Shutter Button Touchy; Grip Small For Weight; Grip Small For Lt Weight<br><br>I have 30+yrs of photog experience, starting with Olympus, then a couple Minoltas, then Nikon.  I shot slides when I wasn&#39;t developing and printing my own B&amp;W.  When I moved to digital, it was to a D80.  D80 was nice, but I was disappointed with low-light/long exposure abilities.  I switched to a Canon 50D and loved the pics, but I missed a lot of the nuances Nikon gave.  So I came back with the D750.  In the last couple months it&#39;s been a solid performer.  You can get way more specs and reviews elsewhere, so no point in my doing that... I&#39;ll just talk about my experience in case it helps anyone...<br><br>The camera is great to handle, but could be a bit bigger (not heavier, just bigger like my Canon 50D or the D8x0 or D7x0) - to manipulate controls, I often have to curl my fingers up a little vs. just resting them relaxed on the camera and slide around.  It just feels a little less stable doing that with this camera.  It feels just a tad too small for the weight with the kit 24-200mm lens, like if it was a hair bigger but the same weight, handling would be better.<br><br>Battery life is good.  Nearly no shutter lag.  Front AND rear IR sensors for IR remote.  2 custom setting banks, yeah!!  Ahhh, back to the good old Nikon controls.  FX is good for me b/c I want a wide FOV (landscapes, nature) and other times want shallow DOF (closeup nature).  But don&#39;t let FX hype get you - you might not get as much bang for your buck w/ FX as hype leads you to believe (ie D7100 = nice camera...)<br><br>Grip 1: I wish the AF points were spread more evenly throughout the viewfinder.  I work on tripod a lot and like to bounce the AF/metering point around checking spot metering and sometimes my focus area WITHOUT mucking around with the tripod.  The points are crammed in the middle of the screen adding annoyance to my shooting.  For instance, shooting a sunset from the mountains, as the light is changing, I like to bounce around taking metering from various spots - dark clouds, sun-lit clouds, foreground, edges, etc.  Also, sometimes in such a low-light scene I need a high-contrast area to focus on that&#39;s juuuust outside the AF area.  Sometimes I end up having to unlock ballhead, reposition direction, focus, flip to manual focus, re-compose, re-lock ballhead, and then finally take pic.  What a pain.  Liveview might take care of this issue for focus, but a) Im a dinosaur and like to look through my camera, and b)for longer exposure stuff, I don&#39;t want to burn my batteries up using LV the entire evening.<br><br>Grip 2:  The shutter button is soooo light it a) feels cheap, and b) it&#39;s hard to half-push to set focus/wake it up.  With eve LIGHT gloves on like I use when shooting in the snow, forget about being able to half-push it.<br><br>I like it, it&#39;s a good camera, and is loaded with awesome little features.  But part of me wishes I had gone up to the D8x0 line.  I don&#39;t need that resolution, have a hard time going beyond what the D750 costs, and frankly, the D750 eats up memory cards and HDDs fast enough shooting RAW.  The D750 has all the high-end features/function I want and the images are awesome, so a solid 4 stars.  It just does not FEEL like a high end camera to me.  For $3k kit price, it should feel better.  In some ways my D80 and Canon 50D both &quot;feel&quot; more solid, smooth, and refined which is sad b/c for price and features, should be stepping up.  If the D750 had just a bit better feel and the selectable AF points covered a little more of the frame, I&#39;d jump up and down and give it 5 stars.  Nah, I&#39;d be taking pictures with it right now instead of writing this long of a review...

4 | Great Lens, Questionable Quality Control | sy | September 3, 2012
Pros: Nice Bokeh; Strong Construction<br><br>Cons: Back focus; Focus shift<br><br>When I received my copy, it was a huge disappointment because it had strong back focus from f1.2 out of box. The lens this price range should have better quality control. Anyway I had to micro-adjust forward to -14 in order to focus properly. I&#39;ve read other reviews, and found out that some people had the same problem as I did. I guess it made me feel a little better knowing I&#39;m not the only one. I was aware of focus shift on this lens, and found out to be true. But it&#39;s not too critical for me.<br><br>At f1.2 images are reasonably sharp. It&#39; gets pretty sharp after post production sharpening. It gets sharper when stopped down. It sometimes creates heavy color fringes at f1.2, and it&#39;s more like ghosting. Also auto focus gets wacky at f1.2 time to time but this may be caused by camera&#39;s focus error (5D MkII in my case), or may be combination of both lens and camera.<br><br>In real life shooting, this lens produces fantastic images as I expected. Now the focus is adjusted, I enjoy playing with it. Portraits with wide aperture creates a certain atmosphere. It has very nice creamy bokeh and good color rendering.<br><br>I&#39;ve been using EF 50mm f1.8 Mark I. This is also one of my favorite lens I&#39;ve owned. Noisy (no USM) but very sharp and compact. In fact if you can find a good copy, I highly recommend it. So I had to think if f1.2L worth ten times more money than this little old lens. If you need wider aperture, better bokeh, strong typical L construction, or USM, then yes, probably so. But if you don&#39;t need them, I say probably not. But it surely gives you the satisfaction of owning one.

5 | Excelent lense for specialized usage | Film photography | March 1, 2014
Cons: Heavy<br><br>This is a specialized lense at f/1.2. My review is  for f/1.2, /1.4, /1.6 apertures. This lense is excellent at smaller apertures from f/5.0 to f/13.0 (smallest) but you are carrying a lot of high quality (heavy) L glass if you are only using those ranges. <br>At f/1.2 it shines most in face-to-face close portraiture photography or in creative 3D compositions with the main subject/object at 0.5 meter to 2.2 meter away and everything else out of focus. f/1.2 is not a good choice for scenes with props and objects around people or if you try to tell a story or document a situation or sports (DoF is very narrow, angle not wide, you cannot have more than one center of attention in your composition unless you close it down). The error most people make including myself initially is to think this is a low light lense that will extend their opportunities without changing their style. Once you set aperture to 1.2 it is a completely different animal and it suits a different type of photography.<br>Quality wise it is solid, well build and works perfectly. My only critic is I sometimes get pictures that I thought i nailed that come out slightly out of focus (back focus ? but i have a film camera). Half of those might be my fault as I shoot hand held (another mistake with this lense at 1.2). But I regularly get very sharp ones (although not razor sharp). That would be my only small grip if I had to name one. The value of this L lense is in getting an incredible artistic feel in the picture due to smoooth bouquet especially for facial portraiture where you want to capture mood of a person or appearance under a certain light it is insurpassable. f/1.2 and 50 mmm is a strange combination. It can lead you to make the &quot;wrong&quot; type of pictures that do not work (this has nothing to do with the lense quality but your understanding of the instrument). There is a button on the lense than when held pressed will hold the shutter down to whatever Av setting so you can see the actual DoF focus through the viewfinder ! This is a very useful trick if you are composing in broad daylight. When you get the lense I suggest you play with that before taking pictures so you develop an inner DoF eye for this lense.<br>Again to me this lense is extremely close to a perfect realisation of a 50mm f/2 design except for maybe not being dead-on absolutely razor sharp no question. I hope I situated this lense well for potential buyers as it seems to be a misunderstood spec combination. It is a huge potential for creative photographers and cannot be replaced by anything else in what it can do.

4 | Quality is amazing, but auto-focus slow | Charles F. | October 15, 2013
Pros: Rugged; Nice Bokeh; Strong Construction<br><br>Cons: Heavy; Slow Focus<br><br>I love the images that this lens produces.  The bokeh (blurred background) is incredible and maybe the best I&#39;ve ever seen from anything I&#39;ve used.   The problem however is the slowness of the auto-focus.  My main reason for buying this lens was to great photos of my daughter who is of toddler age.  The problem is that she moves around way too much for me to be able to capture the moments with this lens.<br><br>I sadly could not justify the cost of this lens over the 50mm f1.4 which is only a quarter of the cost.  Perhaps when my daughter (and future kids) get older I&#39;d be able to better utilize the 50 1.2L.

5 | Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick Review: Ranked on Best PC Joystick | Anonymous | June 30, 2015
Pretty much everything about this joystick is designed well and it&#39;s clear that it was created for easy gaming and PC general use. The stick itself is well-built, though it&#39;s obviously meant for a right-handed user. It has twist sensitivity, along with directional control, with a comfortable mold that lets you play longer and control things with great accuracy. The 12 buttons on it should be more than enough for most games, giving you options to program each one with simple commands or complex macros. This makes it easy for you to play with just the joystick, so you don&#39;t need a mouse or keyboard cluttering up your desk. There&#39;s even an 8-way hat switch that&#8217;s great for POV cockpit views and a small throttle controller for flight simulators. Finally, the trigger button is very sensitive, so you can easily fire rapidly or take your time to line up each shot. This is just a great overall device and Logitech covers it with an unbeatable three year warranty.

5 | Great flight stick for gamers and enthusiasts | MuchShamSuchWow | February 27, 2014

You just plug and play without having to worry about setting up button mapping (for most games). The lack of a separate throttle is annoying, but non-essential for what I play. Logitech my get a bad rap for their quality on occasion, but there is a sturdy feel to it and it does not come off my desk when I move it around. Overall my only gripe would be that it is not as comfortable for lefties like myself because of the hand grip. Other than that it is a definite buy.

5 | My favorite kitchen tool | Lulu | November 29, 2015
I was hesitant to buy this - would it be too heavy, why is a Dutch oven better than my old pan, is a Le Creuset a better Dutch oven? - but I&#39;m thrilled with the results so far.<br><br>Is this heavy? Yes, it is heavy but not so much that i can&#39;t wash it. I have a traditional cast iron camping Dutch oven and skillet that are twice as heavy and difficult to lift and clean. And the high maintenance and needing to season them was a deterrent in using the cast iron kitchen tools so the enamel lining of this was a big draw also. Nothing sticks and it cleans up so easy!<br><br>I had to pick red - my favorite color - and it is &quot;fun&quot; to use and also pretty when it is out on the counter (it makes me happier when I cook). The durability and versatility of this Dutch oven lets me cook things in the oven or on the stove top; my old pan was only for the stove top. I simmered red sauce in it for 1.5 hours today without any scorching and the clean up was SO EASY. The enamel coat is a dream. i see why this is better than my old sauce pan.<br><br>And is it as good as a Le Creuset? I don&#39;t have a Le Creuset but this Dutch Oven appears to be the virtually the same. When I mentioned my conundrum between the Lodge Dutch Oven and Le Creuset to a local kitchen store, they wanted me to buy their Le Creuset they sold based on the only argument that Le Creuset is French and has a great reputation. Beyond that, I don&#39;t see the difference.<br><br>I recommend this in a heart beat. If I could, I&#39;d buy every color!

Its curved AMOLED display looks fantastic, too.<br><br>The Bad: The long display means text reads awkwardly on your wrist. The Fit only works with certain Samsung phones. Can&#8217;t load apps, so you&#8217;re stuck with the features included. And the price is high, so much so that you might consider a cheaper alternative or the same-priced, more full-featured Gear Neo.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Samsung Gear Fit is a great-looking wearable, but doesn&#39;t successfully reconcile its dual roles as activity tracker and smartwatch.

5 | Fantastic Product! | ScottM49 | November 28, 2015
I&#39;ve been using mobile technology since my very first &quot;bag phone&quot; many many years ago. I&#39;ve used so many different brands - until I came across Samsung with my first Galaxy S2 when it first came out... since then, I&#39;ve remained with Samsung due to their superior products and ease of use. This product is no different. I&#39;ve recently come to a point in my life where I&#39;ve decided I need to get back into shape, but oftentimes the &quot;motivation&quot; isn&#39;t there, or the results are skewed over such a long period of time that it&#39;s hard to really see progress. This has changed with the Gear Fit. With a great price-point, and a beautiful sleek design that is SO LIGHT you hardly even know it&#39;s there! This thing tracks my weight, my sleep, my heart-rate - and meshes so seamlessly with my S-Health on my Galaxy S6 that it is so easy to track my results, and thus plan accordingly. I&#39;ve now lost 10 pounds in less than a month, and I pretty much owe it all to this nifty little device and Samsung! Thanks guys!

I received countless compliments daily on the look of my watch. It is the perfect size, shape, and contour to any wrist. It is also extremely durable, it has taken many drops and hits without showing signs of wear. The battery life is phenomenal, it typical last me 3 to 4 days before it requires a charge and I use it constantly. It is quick and easy to access information instead of always looking at my phone, so I can pay attention to what is going on around me and enjoy life.

5 | Works Great, but be patient with old stains | Innkeeper | May 1, 2015
As an innkeeper and mother of five I am constantly battling stains. It is very disheartening to see newly purchased expensive sheets and towels stained beyond saving after only a few days in circulation. I was glad to find Oxi Clean Max Force. I use it for stubborn stains that refuse to disappear after regular wash, pre-soaking with Oxi Clean Powder and manual wash. I first tried it out on a fairly new towel that was doomed to be discarded because after washing, soaking and re-washing the stain was still there. I was especially determined. I just purchased this high quality Egyptian cotton creamy-white towels and the very first week some were covered with yellow-brown stains that would not wash away. I sprayed a good portion of Max Force on, rubbed it in and let it sit for 6 hours. At first there was no change. I kept coming back every day, adding a few sprays onto the stain to keep it soaked and giving it a few rubs. On the seventh day I washed the towel and it was as good as new. I was so impressed I took all the other doomed sheets and towels and patiently gave them the same treatment. This time I kept them in a tub covered with plastic wrap so that Max Force wouldn&#39;t dry up and I would not need to reapply it as much. I saved so many of my precious Egyptian cotton sheets and towels from being thrown away that my time and Max Force&#39;s price are totally worth it. I only wish I could buy it in a larger bottle. I have been so happy with Oxi Clean products in general that I have a positive association with their smells.

I bought this product a few weeks ago and I was horribly disappointed! I have small children who constantly are getting some sort of stain on their little clothes. I treated their clothes with this product (twice) and washed them (twice) and they are still stained!!! Huge waste of money and I will never buy it again. I ended up tossing a lot of shirts because I have been unable to find a product good enough to remove the stains.

They are perfect!<br><br>I also like it that they are easy to wipe down to keep clean and they fold up and slide under my bed or in the closet when I want them out of sight.<br><br>Well worth trying and they are a great price on the Bed, Bath and Beyond site!

Theses steps are very well made and lock easily into position upon unpacking. Even the pads on the steps are well made and easy to put apply. The little non skid nobs are kind of had to see when peeling off. I dropped one and it took awhile to find. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and the price was outstanding. My Maltese took right to these steps and doesn&#39;t have to wake us up from bed when he wants up or down.

4 | Dog Stairs | Mickalow | December 31, 2014
There stairs are very good for the price. I like the fact that they fold up and are light weight. I have a small dog, around 18 lbs, and he doesn&#39;t have any problem using the stairs, but he tends to go up them on the run. I think this is because the steps are not that wide, and he does not feel comfortable going up them one at a time. And, it just may be him, and would not be the same for other dogs.. Over-all, a good valuee.

Bought two of these in gray and black, size XLT. I&#39;m 6&#39;7&quot; 250lbs. Standing with good posture the sleeves end just above my knuckles, which is pretty much perfect. The jackets have room for me to wear an unsulated sweat jacket underneath, which is what I do, but arent to loose to wear alone. After reading some reviews, I see they have added an inside pocket, perfect size for an iphone with case. Other reviews mentioned issues with zippers. They are metal and have worked fine for me so far.

We had to return these pants because they were sized incorrectly. My husband didn&#39;t want to replace them. They were at least 3&quot; to long and the were very baggy. Maybe it had the wrong tag. Levi&#39;s are usually reliable in their sizing. The idea of the pants sounds good with a bit of stretch. Women&#39;s pants have had it for a while now. Men should be comfortable too.

4 | Like the stretch | LeoZ | November 18, 2015
I&#39;m athletically built and I like the fact that they offer these jeans in odd sizes. I was able to get a 33 waist, which is usually hard to find. I really like the stretch material in these jeans and I&#39;ve also bought 505s and 541s with this same material. They fit snug but not tight and the material allows me a comfortable range of motion. The 514s are a little higher in the crotch than the others but they are still comfortable. The 514s are also snugger on my waist than the 505s and the 541s even though they are all waist size 33. I bought the 514s in black and they look great. I&#39;m glad they finally started making mens jeans in this material. I didn&#39;t give excellent ratings because I don&#39;t know how durable these are yet but I love them so far.

5 | Stunning Leather | kodya | December 3, 2015
The leather used on this bag is wonderful. I really like a soft leather as is used in this bag and the black color is lovely and neutral with the gold chain strap. The Mini Convertible Phoebe is bigger than it looks, especially the three inch wide middle compartment. The snap works quickly to secure everything. My concern is that the strap with chain is VERY heavy. It&#39;s actually heavier than the bag. The actual links on the chain are also quite big. I think this may be my preference as I was looking for a small bag and the total weight is more medium because of the chain (my husband agreed on the weight of the chain as I was questioning myself).. All in all, a great Kate Spade look. BTW, the &#39;Kate Spade New York&#39; emblem is so nice - studs instead of stamped. Nordstrom delivery, ordered online Saturday, was on Tuesday!

If you&#39;re looking for a small purse with lots of dividers/pockets, this is it! There is great organization potential but not lots of room so you have to want a small purse. The color is very rich and the style is lovely. It has room for a phone, wallet (7&quot; long), sunglasses, keys, and the extra incidentals like mints, lipstick, gum, etc. but not a big make-up case.

I typically don&#39;t go for smaller handbags, but the interior layout of this one makes it roomier than you might think. The 3 compartment organization along with pockets for your smartphone etc. give it the ability to hold quite a bit. Photos do not do this bag justice, the color and detailing are gorgeous in person. Love the convertible chain and the option to switch from a double chained shoulder bag to a single chain cross body when needed.

Most of the reviews stating that the product is a little loose in some areas are completely correct. There is some extra bunching around the knees. These really are more like pants and you could get away with not wearing another layer on top. Most people don&#39;t realize they are fleece when I wear mine and they are super warm. I like the high waist fit and agree that a draw string would be helpful. If you are handy though, you can install your own.

I ordered these as pants to wear in the house during the winter. They have been great for that --- so warm and comfy.They do stretch out though, which is fine for me cause I&#39;d rather have them be a little loose, but they definitely don&#39;t stay skin tight. I got a small, I&#39;m 5&#39; 5&quot; and 130lb and they fit great. I&#39;ll take these camping once winter is over, and I think they would work great as a nighttime layer as well in that capacity.

Thumb jokes in the sleeves help during colder weather to cover majority of the hand. Others I looked at didn&#39;t have the feature!

3 | Great start but does not age well | D41459 | January 3, 2016
I own 2 and this hoodie is extremely soft on the inner fleece and has stayed that way after many washes. I was disappointed that the out side material becomes almost course over time.

I just love this sweater! Not too heavy and not too light. It&#39;s got a really flattering shape, but also looks really cute. Only complaint is that the fabric has started pilling, otherwise, it would be my favorite sweater.

5 | As the name implies- sexy sweatshirt! | Anonymous | January 18, 2014
I bought this sweatshirt almost a year ago and it has yet to see a week without wear. I bought the color in icicle green and it&#39;s a cool heather light green. I love the half zip- I only wish that the zipper went up farther in the neck. What can I say? I like my neck covered. I bought it in the size small and at 5&#39;8&quot; and 130 it was a good choice for me. The sleeves are perfect length (with much adored thumb holes) and it hits just below my hips. I like that because unlike a lot of Patagonia and Prana tops which are too short on me, this one from Lucy is great. After several washings, the sweatshirt shrank minimally, just just enough for a great fit. I wear this hoodie around the house, in town, and for it&#39;s intended purpose, to yoga class and back again. I also have another Lucy yoga top and feel the same about it. Good brand- worth the money, especially on sale! The cotton is soft yet durable. It seems to be double lined, with a tricot inner liner. The kangaroo pocket is clutch!

4 | Nice All-around Sweatshirt | Anonymous | December 19, 2013
I really like this sweatshirt, it&#39;s great for running errands, hiking, or just hanging out at the house. If you layer it with a thermal underneath it keeps you plenty warm. Or just a tank top for the fall, so I like that it is versatile. The only complaint that I have is that after washing and drying, it seemed to shrink up a bit, not too terrible but I liked it better prior to the wash. I would recommend air dying this one.

I had to get this when it went on sale- it&#39;s so pretty and really sparkles! It&#39;s my first Roberto Coin piece and will not be my last. The only reason I docked it a star, is because contrary to what the description and other reviewers said, it does not have an extender on the chain. It&#39;s 16&quot; and that&#39;s it- I had planned to layer this so this threw me off. Going to nordstrom to see what they can do about it... Other than that, I love love it! Don&#39;t hesitate if you love simple but striking everyday/dainty jewelry. Especially for the sale price :)

When I saw this watch I fell in love with it, so I bought it from House of Fraser.. but unfortunately a month later some part of the watch started to go rusty ( No contact with perfume) and because the refund period was over I could not get my money so they gave me gift card at that value!!! after spending so much i did not expect this to happened within a month!! I was so disappointed with my purchase and would Not recommend this watch to anyone!!!

5 | Really pretty watch! | FLItalia0629 | July 17, 2015
This watch looks great on and great with a tan. It has the gold and silver so I can vary the other jewelry I wear with it. It has the date and glow in the dark hands (if they&#39;ve been in a room to absorb light first). If you walk into a darkened room from a lighted one you can read the watch. Worked great at the theater.

I bought this watch as a xmas gift for my boyfriend&#39;s mom. Decent sized case, not too big and not too small. Considering she does not like the oversized modern &quot;boyfriend&quot; look of watches, this watch&#39;s size was perfect enough to make a statement without being too out there. The rose gold tone is gorgeous and feminine, and the diamond marker is subtle and pretty and stands out beautifully against the shiny mirrored dial!

Great in every way, except one. The latch (the hook part), doesn&#39;t open fully. So hooking it around to put on or trying to get it unlatched isn&#39;t simple and quick. Takes me a few times. That&#39;s the only issue I have w/it. Went back to the counter and that&#39;s how they&#39;re all made.

This product is great beacuse it is similar to my phone with the apps, but fun and safe for her to use.  One thing that I dis like is there is no volume, so if we are out in public the volume is too low and my daughter can not hear it so she will lose interest.

Recommended by both pediatricians and parents, Desitin Maximum Strength Original Paste made this list because of its potent rash-fighting ingredients. Desitin offers the highest concentration of zinc oxide youll find in a diaper cream, which makes it an effective product for even severe diaper rashes. Parents say this is one of the thickest creams on the market. While some parents say this can make it somewhat difficult to apply, most moms say it forms an effective barrier and offers superior protection for babys delicate skin.

Pros: Colorful and Fun; Easy to Wash; Easy to Grip<br><br>Cons: Hard Plastic<br><br>My 3 month old enjoys this toy. It is designed to be held easily by small hands. It is the only rattle I found that was the right size for a small hand. In the 2 weeks that we have had it my son has improved his ability to grasp it on his own and shake it. He loves the sound and shakes it a lot. Unfortunately it is very hard plastic so when he gets excited and shakes it he hits himself and cries because it hurts. I wish I could find a soft rattle that he could grab easily and makes loud noise ( wrist rattles are not loud enough to keep his interest).

Only downside it that if you need to wipe it down you have to make sure the cloth isn&#39;t too wet or water gets into the cylinder which is a mold risk.

I bought this for my baby&#39;s room after having a crane elephant humidifier. The crane was harder to clean and seemed to get moldy even with daily emptying. This humidifier is awesome! I can go a couple of days before emptying it and it doesn&#39;t get gross. It is compact and light weight. The only bad part of it being light weight is that you can&#39;t flip the power switch with one hand, which isn&#39;t that big of a deal. I love that I can turn the top of it to have the mist spray two ways to cover more of the room. Would buy again for sure!

My first impressions of this primer when wearing it a few times now under my BB cream is that it is very slick. It has a very silicone-y feel to it. I can easily see oily people hating this because of the fact that is goes on super slick. I would image this would feel very greasy on an oily person. I have dry to combo skin and even the slickness of this is almost too much for me. I will say however, that it does a very good job of filling in my pores and creating a very smooth like finish to my face. For the price this is a very decent primer and I am pleasantly surprised with the results.<br>Just be careful because one full pump is far too much for the entire face.

5 | NARS Powder Blush Review: Ranked on Best Powder Blush | Anonymous | December 17, 2013
With so many options to choose from, anyone can find the perfect color for them. The blushes are perfect for both warm and cool-toned complexions. Girls who like shimmer can find several options, as can those who prefer a matte finish to their cheeks. And although the colors may look intense in the package, it is easy to apply them in a way that gives a natural flush. They are long-lasting and never look chalky.

5 | LOVE NARS BLUSHES | foiledd | December 9, 2014
I own about 10 of them and I love every one of them!! Here are some of my faves:<br>&quot;Exhibit A&quot; is easy to over use, but the colour is gorgeous on. One dab and one sweep, bam.<br>&quot;Orgas m&quot; is an award winning classic. The gold shimmer looks good on any skin tone.<br>&quot;Deep Throat&quot; is amazing too! I have a back up of this one just in case!<br>&quot;Se x Fantasy&quot; is very natural looking.<br>&quot;Albatross&quot; is a very nice highlighter to go on the tops of your cheek bones on any of these colours.<br>&quot;Gaiety&quot; is a nice light pink and build able depending on the look you are going for.<br>&quot;Laguna&quot; I got in the Holiday limited edition pack and you get a bigger size in that one than the single ones.

I have pretty pale skin, and I like how this blush doesn&#39;t look overly pink and how it has the right amount of shimmer. Love the look and size of the packaging. My go-to every-day blush.

I too got this for my birthday gift and repurchased as the full size. I love the rikugien color as an every day medium pink, but for the price I was expecting a twist up lipstick like all the other brands have been doing. I did not expect to need to sharpen this product and watch bits of the product get sharpened off.

Goes on smoothly, stays on well, and is a great everyday color. I wear it most days at work and reapply a few times throughout the day. Easy to apply without a mirror because of the slim size.

2 | Love the product, hate having to sharpen | lsands22 | June 29, 2015
I received this product as a sample with my birthday gift from Sephora and fell in love!! So much so that I bought a full size. It goes on smooth and feels wonderful, perfect amount of shimmer and sheerness while still giving me noticeable colour.<br><br>The problem: you have to sharpen the pencil. I was expecting a twist up, especially for $30+ and am extremely disappointed. Having to carry a pencil sharpener and deal with the mess is annoying and inconvenient. I have tried to match the colour in a lipstick by nars...and then by any other manufacturer and have been unable to find something just right...<br><br>Nars - please make these pencils a twist up and not a sharpen.

4 | Would have been 5 Star if full sized | prussia | May 8, 2014
I already own one multiple and I enjoyed the ease of use and convenience of the stick color, but I wanted a matte shade. Finally Nars has released multiples that are matte!<br><br>These are half the size of a normal multiple and the same price. I don&#8217;t like that because there are many color sticks that are far far less costly. Also my package is now fraying around the edges, it is like the matte black packaging is peeling off! (It has only been about 4 months with this) Yakh!!<br><br>I bought the color Anguilla this is described as a ginger pink and I view it as more of a cool toned pink with a hint of orange. I love this as a blush because it is creamy but not so much that it is slippery. It is pigmented enough that you get a nice color payoff and it can&#8217;t be overdone. I enjoy this as a lip product but you need to have moisturized lips to make these work, because they are dry, and will emphasize dry patches. (hence why I do not have a picture that includes it on my lips!)<br><br>I really enjoy the texture of this stick because it is not sticky, greasy or shiny. I am thinking about buying more, but because there are so many options for cheaper color sticks I will have to pass.

4 | Review: Matte Multiple | soleita | August 31, 2014
Bought Altai for cream contouring and I love it!<br>I use a Sephora #75 brush. It remains blendable for a couple of minutes, so you don&#8217;t have to feel too rushed. Wears for about 8 hrs. The texture feels silicone-like, almost velvety, light to medium weight, and smooth.<br>The only drawback is the price and cost of course.

5 | It's great! | CupcakeKitty | May 19, 2014
I got it in Altai and I use it to contour my face along with my Luxor multiple to highlight. It&#39;s very easy to blend with your fingers. Altai looks very natural on my fair/light skin tone&#8212; I wanted to get Vientiane at first but that looks way to orange when I swatched it on my hand in store. (I think Vientiane will look nice on gals with olive/darker skin tones) It lasts around five hours on my normal/combination skin. Only wish it could come in the same size as their original multiples, though.

5 | Really nice product. | VastPyche | January 19, 2016
It was exactly what I was hoping for, but the tounge is attached with the sides near your ankle which is different from most shoes so if your foot is wide or fat like mine itll take a few more seconds to put the shoes on but its possible and is still true to the size I was looking for.

I have two different pairs of nike air huarache and i love them.... But i received these navy camo ones as a gift from a friend and they were ordered online . The pair that was sent were oddly shaped in the front and felt cheaply made compared to the other two pairs of air huarache I own . I guess the only pro is that the color wasnt different than what the pic shows online. i recommend going to purchase these shoes in store .

I purchased this adorable bag in the &quot;port&quot; color because it reminds me so much of the Philip Lim mini Pashli at a fraction of the cost. This is the ideal size for the essentials, wallet, phone, lipstick, brush with a bit of room to spare. The color is a gorgeous wine in person and the leather is deliciously soft while still holding it&#39;s shape. Overall, highly recommend. Seriously considering another color!

5 | Perfect for dry, itchy skin | Veta60 | August 17, 2015
Pros: Easy To Use; Moisturizes; Good Value<br><br>I put this on after my bath and my skin looks and feels great.  I don&#39;t have Eczema, but do have a few areas of mild psoriasis that respond well to a little sun exposure everyday.  But I do find my skin tends to be dry and does itch if I don&#39;t pamper it.  Aveeno products help me do that.  I use their bath oil, shave cream, and this.  I&#39;ve been using their products for a while now and will continue to do so as  the improvement in my skin keeps me from feeling self conscious in an area of the country where flip flops, sleeveless tops, and shorts are your daily wardrobe.  I&#39;m 60 and my skin feels and looks better than it did 10-15 years ago when I was busy with work and just neglected it and wore long sleeves and long pants everyday.  I never though I would be comfortable out in public with sleeveless tops and shorts.  Thanks Aveeno!

5 | BEST MOISTURIZER EVER! | happycamper | May 2, 2015
Pros: Easy To Use; Fragrance free; Gentle; Moisturizes<br><br>Okay, so i never ever do reviews. But this had to be said. For about 2 years now I&#39;ve suffered from moderate to severe acne on my forehead, chin, and nose. Along with that, i have combination skin AND eczema on my face and arms. SMH! It was horrible. I mean red, itchy, bumpy, and everything made it worse. I&#39;ve tried everything over the counter, generic, cheap, expensive, you name the product and I have likely tried it. My doctor supplied me with steroids for my eczema, which helped stop the itching but somehow made me break out more. So long story short, I went online for about 3 days searching for a product that worked for acne and eczema. Now know that what works for me may not work for everyone and also I am not saying this product alone will cure acne. What I am saying is, this moisturizer is simply one of the best to keep your face and body moisturized without being too greasy. My face is smooth and soft and ACNE FREE. Here is what I did.<br><br>In the morning I wash my face with Panoxyl 10% BP (use the 4% if your skin is toooo sensitive). For this I just use a small dime size because alot goes a long way and plus its a foaming wash.<br>I then dry my face with a towel, apply the Aveeno Hydro Cortisone mixed with a dime size of the Aveeno Moisturizing Cream.<br>I repeat this again at night and WALLAH! In a week my face was COMPLETELY clear. I only had one or two pimple scars that I cleared with lemon &amp; tomato juice.<br><br>GET THIS PRODUCT!! for all skin types

5 | BEST ECZEMA TREATMENT OUT THERE | MelissaD | April 22, 2015
I have severe hand eczema and have tried everything. And I mean everything: prescription steroid ointments, Cortisone shot, coconut oil, vaseline, vinegar, etc. Nothing seemed to help. When I read the reviews of this cream, I was still skeptical but decided to give it a try. My first use was last night, and it was awesome. It felt so good when I put it on. It didn&#39;t burn either. When I woke up, my hands felt so good, smooth, and no itching. I put more on once I got to work, and I&#39;m loving this cream. I&#39;m hoping my eczema will go into remission soon. I know it&#39;s because I&#39;m under a lot of stress right now. I paid the same price for this cream as a prescription would have been , but I get a lot more in this cream and don&#39;t have to pay to see a doctor. To be honest, I&#39;d pay a lot more for this cream because it&#39;s that good and better for your body than any prescriptions. So if you&#39;re still skeptical, just give it a try.

This gentle product gives you a deep down clean and it&#8217;s also water-based, making it ideal for all skin types.

1 | Terrible | Disappointed | June 17, 2015
Cons: Wears Off Easily<br><br>This does not work as a clear coat. I did not use it over other polish, but as a clear coat, it flaked off the next day. It&#39;s very thin, so I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s a great top coat either. Not that shiny (shiny is a great top coat, by the way), and wore off so fast, leaving my nails looking terrible. I thought for the price it was going to be quality, but it was not.

5 | Best top coat | Pink | July 11, 2014
Pros: Good Value; Easy To Apply; High shine; Fast Drying<br><br>Really great top coat. Extremely high shine, similar to getting a gel manicure, without the hassle of trying to get gel nail polish off! The trick is to put on thinner layers. If you pile it on too thick, the top coat will adhere to the colored layers below, and it will make the entire polish easy to peel off (thicker layer, easier to peel off... makes sense). Again, I don&#39;t really have issues with polish shrinkage unless I put too thick of a layer on. Usually, after 5-10 minutes, my polish is dry and I can start using my hands to do regular tasks.

5 | The best! | shopqueen | August 17, 2015
Pros: Easy To Apply; Long Lasting; Good Value<br><br>Seche Vite is the gold standard in top coats. It&#39;s used in every nail salon I&#39;ve ever been to. When I do my own nails I always use this as a top coat. It needs to be used when the nails are still slightly wet with polish. It dries fast, the coat is very shiny, it smooths any imperfections in a manicure and makes a manicure last incredibly long.

4 | Motivates me to move | Moose and Squirrel | September 24, 2015
This replaced my Fitbit Charge (non HR) after its battery died prematurely.<br><br>There&#39;s two reasons to get something like this. One is if you need some motivation to move. I check my steps before lunch and when I get home from work. If the count is low, lunch includes a mile walk or the dogs get an extra long walk after work. The other reason is if you are doing Weight Watchers, and want your activity points automatically calculated. The Charge HR does a much better job with non-walking activities (bike riding, weight lifting) than the Charge or WW&#39;s old tracker did.<br><br>Pros: The fitbit smartphone software is fabulous. I wish every app was this stable and easy to use. The fitbit itself is stylish enough that I can wear it to fancy business things, but rugged enough that I don&#39;t worry about it when I&#39;m active. The alarms are fabulous -- the vibration is enough to get your attention, but not obnoxious enough to disturb others.<br><br>Cons: The Charge HR needs to be worn snugly, which means the clasp sometimes pinches or rubs, causing some irritation. The charging cord is very short, which means the watch is hanging in mid-air if you are charging from a wall outlet. The button on the Charge HR is too easily pressed just by moving your arm (did not have this problem with the Charge) -- this makes the battery life a bit shorter. I get about 3.5 days on a full charge, not the five claimed.<br><br>Summary: I would buy this again in a heartbeat. (Pun intended)

4 | Works for me | SolMan | June 11, 2015
Have tried several &quot;non-slip&quot; mats and this one is the best so far. The surface does scuff up easily compared to other mats, but it&#39;s a minor annoyance. The non-slip surface of the mat is just a thin layer however so we&#39;ll see how long it stays adhered to the rest of the mat. Like the design. Would like to see more color choices in the future.

5 | Awesome Mat | Snuffy01 | December 16, 2015
I love this mat for Hot Yoga. I used to use a thin non slip mat and a towel. This was a pain moving the towel and if the mat got wet I would slip. Also I had little protection as the mat was thin. I sweat allot and this mat takes care of the sweat and I have not slipped yet. (I am a slipper) I was at Hot Yoga and there were about 24 people in the class in a small room and it was really really hot. I was sweating like I had a faucet attached to me. The sweat started to gather on the mat and still I did not slip. The thickness is perfect as it protects my knees. I give this mat an 11 out of 10. The only issue I have is when the mat arrived it was rather scuffed up. This really disappointed me. I took pics and customer service did say they would replace the mat but I did not want to wait the week to ship to them and another week to get another one back. I wanted to keep using the SOL and I could not go back to the other mat even for 2 weeks.

I purchased my second mat and love it. †The extra thickness provides padding for my knees and other joints. †This is a durable , non slip high quality matt which stands up to a hot ,sweaty vinyasa yoga class. † Worth the higher price †but does loses it non stick features after 18 months of heavy use.

5 | Best toddler formula out there!! | bajira | June 2, 2015
Baby loves this, and I was able to transition form breast feeding to this really easy without any fuss. I love the fact that it has the DHA/ARA and its organic and no bad chemicals or bleach process. Only complaint is the small size. Wish they came in a larger container. One can lasts me about 4 days. with 3-4 feedings with 4-6 oz each time.

5 | Baby loves it--safest formula on the market | BB1020 | March 15, 2015
I use this formula to supplement and my baby loves it!!! Vitacost has the best price out there for this product (that I have found)!<br>If you are looking for a safe formula for your baby-Baby&#39;s Only is the way to go! They are the ONLY formula company that uses an FDA approved method (and safe method) for extracting DHA and ARA.

After much research, I decided on this formula for my baby. All three of my older kids used a more popular name brand, non-organic. I have had less issues with this formula with this baby than all three of my other kids put together. It is great quality!

4.2 | Real surround from a giant sound bar | Matthew Moskovciak | March 24, 2015
The Good: The Vizio S5451w-C2 sound bar includes two rear speakers, allowing it to deliver a real surround sound experience from a sound bar system. The sound bar itself is jumbo-size, creating more stereo separation than traditional systems, and the plus-size sub creates more bass. It&#39;s also packed with features, including two HDMI inputs, Bluetooth, and a remote with a built-in display.<br><br>The Bad: Truly massive system, especially compared with other sound bars. The sound bar&#39;s height might block your TV&#39;s remote sensor. And you can get similar surround-sound effects from Vizio&#39;s smaller 5.1 sound bar for half the price.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Vizio S5451W-C2&#39;s extra-large sound bar and surround speakers deliver standout surround sound, if you can live with the size.

After doing extensive research, not only on quality but price of product and not to mention innovation, i decided to check out this Vizio 54.<br>I have.... excuse me had ...a Harman Kardon Sb26 aka($600.00 plus tax), and in a nutshell the vizio blew it out of the water.<br>I am so impressed with Vizio from their boxing and set up instructions, super easy!!! To the quality of a 5.1 for the soundbar category.<br><br>In &quot;laymans&quot; terms this thing is SICK OR TIGHT OR AWESOME!!<br><br>Get it!!! VIZIO is definitely headed in the correct direction...at this rate I expect good things. Any ways my favorite thing is the 5.1 with wireless sub... Granted the sb 26 had deeper bass (10 v 8) the fact that i can hook up 2 satellite speakers to the wireless subs is AMAZING...<br>Vizio has done something no one else has been able to...I won der if they know????<br><br>P. S Best Buy please work on your customer service<br>I would never treat a customer like that

4 | Rear speakers make this my go to sound bar | gnewengland | April 29, 2015
The rear speakers make this my sound bar of choice. I like that you don&#39;t have to rely on sound reflections to recreate surround sound... As with the majority of sound bar systems, I wish the subwoofer were more substantial. Vizio has several models for this line and this has the largest subwoofer (8&quot; driver) as well as an expanded bar (I believe the drivers are upgraded). Very easy to setup and at $499 ($399 on sale) is still a great value. There are systems with better bars and subwoofers (mostly more expensive) for sure - but none will give you the rear channel.<br><br>Can&#39;t compete with a true 5.1+ setup, but I think this is among the best compromises if you want great sound and surround effects without cluttering up the living room with wires. Adds great depth to the audio of a home theater and makes for a nice, clean, sleek setup!

4 | Great computer, very light, thin , and fast!! | Taco | September 2, 2015
This computer is great, it&#39;s fast and very portable because it is so light and thin. The screen looks great and it has good battery life. The sleek design not only looks sharp, but is very convenient as well when carrying it. If I had to say anything about it, is that it doesn&#39;t have a backlit keyboard. This is worth the buy if your looking for a portable, speed demon of a machine.

I bought this chromebook for my sister-in-law who is starting a web based business. She is a busy mom always on the go and this gives her web access and computing power to do business on the go. I was pleased with the service at Office Depot when purchasing this. From what I understand she is pleased with the size, portability, and battery life of this device.

My hubby only gets on FB and his hunting &amp; fishing forums. He wanted something that wasn&#39;t taking up space on his end table but with a screen he could see. Tablets just were too small - this is perfect! He likes the keyboard and screen size is good. So far no problem with battery life - can keep it plugged in if necessary ;) Great buy for what we need it for!

3.2 | Not good, but good for the price if you're a Prime member | Xiomara Blanco | November 12, 2015
The Good: The Amazon Fire tablet definitely isn&#39;t overpriced. It runs a user-friendly operating system and houses a microSD card slot expandable up to 128GB. Amazon Prime members can access the bevy of free TV shows, movies and games included in the subscription.<br><br>The Bad: The design feels cheap. Performance is slow if many apps are open in the background and when downloading. The display has a low resolution and touchscreen response can be sluggish. Gaming performance for large games is slow and the graphics can experience frame rate drops.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Amazon Fire is a fine tablet for casual use, but it&#39;s not a good tablet, it&#39;s just good for the price.

4 | Good entry level tablet! | Applehatersux | December 11, 2015
I read mixed reviews on these tablets and nearly talked myself out of buying one, but then on Black Friday the price hit 35 bucks temporarily, so I bought it.<br><br>I am really happy that I did.<br><br>While it&#39;s no where near that of the Apple devices in overall image quality, it puts out a pretty nice screen view with plenty of color and brightness.<br><br>I was able to download all the main social media apps, several streaming content apps, and plenty of games to mess around with all for free. So far only 1 app has &quot;crashed&quot; on me resulting in a restart.<br><br>The size is perfect, almost fits in a man&#39;s jeans back pocket without a case, but large enough to enjoy looking at for extended periods.<br><br>Battery seems to hold up well, and the buttons are working as they should, with quick transitions and processing.<br><br>I added a 64GB SD card to store things later, but I never planned on using it for much more than an around the house browsing or streaming device.<br><br>The camera works well.<br><br>The sound is decent.<br><br>They make cases just like that of the Apple tablets for as little as 8 bucks.<br><br>Bottom line, it&#39;s not the best tablet, but it is a good one for someone who&#39;s never used one or just wants one for general purpose use. I would trust a device from Amazon a lot quicker then some of these cheaper tablets.<br><br>We bought 4 more to give away at Christmas we liked ours so much.

4 | all the OM-D you need in a small package | Mike Honey | March 12, 2014
This is a proper OM-D camera, cut down in size maybe, but not missing many features.  The wifi and focus peaking are new and very welcome additions.  The image quality is awesome and the autofocus is fast (just like with the previous OM-D models).  There are plenty of m4/3 lenses to choose from...  I am very happy with my purchase!  I can take DSLR-quality pictures with a camera that fits into a jacket pocket.<br><br>The cons are few.  As has no doubt been mentioned before, the menu system is needlessly complicated and is in bad need of an overhaul.  I also wish there was an easier way to set up and recall custom settings - why doesn&#39;t Olympus put C1, C2 on the mode dial like so many other manufacturers?<br><br>Other than that I can whole-heartedly recommend this amazing little camera.  Thanks Olympus for not deliberately crippling it like many other brands would have!

4 | Great camera, not perfect | gumby | February 17, 2015
Pros: Good dynamic range; Fast Focus; Lightweight; Awesome in low light; Responsive; Awesome Low Light<br><br>Cons: Just Slightly Too Small; Shutter Button Touchy; Grip Small For Weight; Grip Small For Lt Weight<br><br>I have 30+yrs of photog experience, starting with Olympus, then a couple Minoltas, then Nikon.  I shot slides when I wasn&#39;t developing and printing my own B&amp;W.  When I moved to digital, it was to a D80.  D80 was nice, but I was disappointed with low-light/long exposure abilities.  I switched to a Canon 50D and loved the pics, but I missed a lot of the nuances Nikon gave.  So I came back with the D750.  In the last couple months it&#39;s been a solid performer.  You can get way more specs and reviews elsewhere, so no point in my doing that... I&#39;ll just talk about my experience in case it helps anyone...<br><br>The camera is great to handle, but could be a bit bigger (not heavier, just bigger like my Canon 50D or the D8x0 or D7x0) - to manipulate controls, I often have to curl my fingers up a little vs. just resting them relaxed on the camera and slide around.  It just feels a little less stable doing that with this camera.  It feels just a tad too small for the weight with the kit 24-200mm lens, like if it was a hair bigger but the same weight, handling would be better.<br><br>Battery life is good.  Nearly no shutter lag.  Front AND rear IR sensors for IR remote.  2 custom setting banks, yeah!!  Ahhh, back to the good old Nikon controls.  FX is good for me b/c I want a wide FOV (landscapes, nature) and other times want shallow DOF (closeup nature).  But don&#39;t let FX hype get you - you might not get as much bang for your buck w/ FX as hype leads you to believe (ie D7100 = nice camera...)<br><br>Grip 1: I wish the AF points were spread more evenly throughout the viewfinder.  I work on tripod a lot and like to bounce the AF/metering point around checking spot metering and sometimes my focus area WITHOUT mucking around with the tripod.  The points are crammed in the middle of the screen adding annoyance to my shooting.  For instance, shooting a sunset from the mountains, as the light is changing, I like to bounce around taking metering from various spots - dark clouds, sun-lit clouds, foreground, edges, etc.  Also, sometimes in such a low-light scene I need a high-contrast area to focus on that&#39;s juuuust outside the AF area.  Sometimes I end up having to unlock ballhead, reposition direction, focus, flip to manual focus, re-compose, re-lock ballhead, and then finally take pic.  What a pain.  Liveview might take care of this issue for focus, but a) Im a dinosaur and like to look through my camera, and b)for longer exposure stuff, I don&#39;t want to burn my batteries up using LV the entire evening.<br><br>Grip 2:  The shutter button is soooo light it a) feels cheap, and b) it&#39;s hard to half-push to set focus/wake it up.  With eve LIGHT gloves on like I use when shooting in the snow, forget about being able to half-push it.<br><br>I like it, it&#39;s a good camera, and is loaded with awesome little features.  But part of me wishes I had gone up to the D8x0 line.  I don&#39;t need that resolution, have a hard time going beyond what the D750 costs, and frankly, the D750 eats up memory cards and HDDs fast enough shooting RAW.  The D750 has all the high-end features/function I want and the images are awesome, so a solid 4 stars.  It just does not FEEL like a high end camera to me.  For $3k kit price, it should feel better.  In some ways my D80 and Canon 50D both &quot;feel&quot; more solid, smooth, and refined which is sad b/c for price and features, should be stepping up.  If the D750 had just a bit better feel and the selectable AF points covered a little more of the frame, I&#39;d jump up and down and give it 5 stars.  Nah, I&#39;d be taking pictures with it right now instead of writing this long of a review...

4 | Great Lens, Questionable Quality Control | sy | September 3, 2012
Pros: Nice Bokeh; Strong Construction<br><br>Cons: Back focus; Focus shift<br><br>When I received my copy, it was a huge disappointment because it had strong back focus from f1.2 out of box. The lens this price range should have better quality control. Anyway I had to micro-adjust forward to -14 in order to focus properly. I&#39;ve read other reviews, and found out that some people had the same problem as I did. I guess it made me feel a little better knowing I&#39;m not the only one. I was aware of focus shift on this lens, and found out to be true. But it&#39;s not too critical for me.<br><br>At f1.2 images are reasonably sharp. It&#39; gets pretty sharp after post production sharpening. It gets sharper when stopped down. It sometimes creates heavy color fringes at f1.2, and it&#39;s more like ghosting. Also auto focus gets wacky at f1.2 time to time but this may be caused by camera&#39;s focus error (5D MkII in my case), or may be combination of both lens and camera.<br><br>In real life shooting, this lens produces fantastic images as I expected. Now the focus is adjusted, I enjoy playing with it. Portraits with wide aperture creates a certain atmosphere. It has very nice creamy bokeh and good color rendering.<br><br>I&#39;ve been using EF 50mm f1.8 Mark I. This is also one of my favorite lens I&#39;ve owned. Noisy (no USM) but very sharp and compact. In fact if you can find a good copy, I highly recommend it. So I had to think if f1.2L worth ten times more money than this little old lens. If you need wider aperture, better bokeh, strong typical L construction, or USM, then yes, probably so. But if you don&#39;t need them, I say probably not. But it surely gives you the satisfaction of owning one.

5 | Excelent lense for specialized usage | Film photography | March 1, 2014
Cons: Heavy<br><br>This is a specialized lense at f/1.2. My review is  for f/1.2, /1.4, /1.6 apertures. This lense is excellent at smaller apertures from f/5.0 to f/13.0 (smallest) but you are carrying a lot of high quality (heavy) L glass if you are only using those ranges. <br>At f/1.2 it shines most in face-to-face close portraiture photography or in creative 3D compositions with the main subject/object at 0.5 meter to 2.2 meter away and everything else out of focus. f/1.2 is not a good choice for scenes with props and objects around people or if you try to tell a story or document a situation or sports (DoF is very narrow, angle not wide, you cannot have more than one center of attention in your composition unless you close it down). The error most people make including myself initially is to think this is a low light lense that will extend their opportunities without changing their style. Once you set aperture to 1.2 it is a completely different animal and it suits a different type of photography.<br>Quality wise it is solid, well build and works perfectly. My only critic is I sometimes get pictures that I thought i nailed that come out slightly out of focus (back focus ? but i have a film camera). Half of those might be my fault as I shoot hand held (another mistake with this lense at 1.2). But I regularly get very sharp ones (although not razor sharp). That would be my only small grip if I had to name one. The value of this L lense is in getting an incredible artistic feel in the picture due to smoooth bouquet especially for facial portraiture where you want to capture mood of a person or appearance under a certain light it is insurpassable. f/1.2 and 50 mmm is a strange combination. It can lead you to make the &quot;wrong&quot; type of pictures that do not work (this has nothing to do with the lense quality but your understanding of the instrument). There is a button on the lense than when held pressed will hold the shutter down to whatever Av setting so you can see the actual DoF focus through the viewfinder ! This is a very useful trick if you are composing in broad daylight. When you get the lense I suggest you play with that before taking pictures so you develop an inner DoF eye for this lense.<br>Again to me this lense is extremely close to a perfect realisation of a 50mm f/2 design except for maybe not being dead-on absolutely razor sharp no question. I hope I situated this lense well for potential buyers as it seems to be a misunderstood spec combination. It is a huge potential for creative photographers and cannot be replaced by anything else in what it can do.

4 | Quality is amazing, but auto-focus slow | Charles F. | October 15, 2013
Pros: Rugged; Nice Bokeh; Strong Construction<br><br>Cons: Heavy; Slow Focus<br><br>I love the images that this lens produces.  The bokeh (blurred background) is incredible and maybe the best I&#39;ve ever seen from anything I&#39;ve used.   The problem however is the slowness of the auto-focus.  My main reason for buying this lens was to great photos of my daughter who is of toddler age.  The problem is that she moves around way too much for me to be able to capture the moments with this lens.<br><br>I sadly could not justify the cost of this lens over the 50mm f1.4 which is only a quarter of the cost.  Perhaps when my daughter (and future kids) get older I&#39;d be able to better utilize the 50 1.2L.

5 | Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick Review: Ranked on Best PC Joystick | Anonymous | June 30, 2015
Pretty much everything about this joystick is designed well and it&#39;s clear that it was created for easy gaming and PC general use. The stick itself is well-built, though it&#39;s obviously meant for a right-handed user. It has twist sensitivity, along with directional control, with a comfortable mold that lets you play longer and control things with great accuracy. The 12 buttons on it should be more than enough for most games, giving you options to program each one with simple commands or complex macros. This makes it easy for you to play with just the joystick, so you don&#39;t need a mouse or keyboard cluttering up your desk. There&#39;s even an 8-way hat switch that&#8217;s great for POV cockpit views and a small throttle controller for flight simulators. Finally, the trigger button is very sensitive, so you can easily fire rapidly or take your time to line up each shot. This is just a great overall device and Logitech covers it with an unbeatable three year warranty.

You just plug and play without having to worry about setting up button mapping (for most games). The lack of a separate throttle is annoying, but non-essential for what I play. Logitech my get a bad rap for their quality on occasion, but there is a sturdy feel to it and it does not come off my desk when I move it around. Overall my only gripe would be that it is not as comfortable for lefties like myself because of the hand grip. Other than that it is a definite buy.

5 | My favorite kitchen tool | Lulu | November 29, 2015
I was hesitant to buy this - would it be too heavy, why is a Dutch oven better than my old pan, is a Le Creuset a better Dutch oven? - but I&#39;m thrilled with the results so far.<br><br>Is this heavy? Yes, it is heavy but not so much that i can&#39;t wash it. I have a traditional cast iron camping Dutch oven and skillet that are twice as heavy and difficult to lift and clean. And the high maintenance and needing to season them was a deterrent in using the cast iron kitchen tools so the enamel lining of this was a big draw also. Nothing sticks and it cleans up so easy!<br><br>I had to pick red - my favorite color - and it is &quot;fun&quot; to use and also pretty when it is out on the counter (it makes me happier when I cook). The durability and versatility of this Dutch oven lets me cook things in the oven or on the stove top; my old pan was only for the stove top. I simmered red sauce in it for 1.5 hours today without any scorching and the clean up was SO EASY. The enamel coat is a dream. i see why this is better than my old sauce pan.<br><br>And is it as good as a Le Creuset? I don&#39;t have a Le Creuset but this Dutch Oven appears to be the virtually the same. When I mentioned my conundrum between the Lodge Dutch Oven and Le Creuset to a local kitchen store, they wanted me to buy their Le Creuset they sold based on the only argument that Le Creuset is French and has a great reputation. Beyond that, I don&#39;t see the difference.<br><br>I recommend this in a heart beat. If I could, I&#39;d buy every color!

I bought this because it was a great deal and Lodge has such a good reputation. The colors look nice, too (mine is blue). I was disappointed, however, to find that it is made in China, not in the USA, which I was led to believe and was a selling point.

3.6 | Curved-screen fitness smartwatch one step short | Scott Stein | July 3, 2014
The Good: The Gear Fit has a forward-looking design, many more extras than the average fitness band, and the ability to measure heart rate. Its curved AMOLED display looks fantastic, too.<br><br>The Bad: The long display means text reads awkwardly on your wrist. The Fit only works with certain Samsung phones. Can&#8217;t load apps, so you&#8217;re stuck with the features included. And the price is high, so much so that you might consider a cheaper alternative or the same-priced, more full-featured Gear Neo.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Samsung Gear Fit is a great-looking wearable, but doesn&#39;t successfully reconcile its dual roles as activity tracker and smartwatch.

5 | Fantastic Product! | ScottM49 | November 28, 2015
I&#39;ve been using mobile technology since my very first &quot;bag phone&quot; many many years ago. I&#39;ve used so many different brands - until I came across Samsung with my first Galaxy S2 when it first came out... since then, I&#39;ve remained with Samsung due to their superior products and ease of use. This product is no different. I&#39;ve recently come to a point in my life where I&#39;ve decided I need to get back into shape, but oftentimes the &quot;motivation&quot; isn&#39;t there, or the results are skewed over such a long period of time that it&#39;s hard to really see progress. This has changed with the Gear Fit. With a great price-point, and a beautiful sleek design that is SO LIGHT you hardly even know it&#39;s there! This thing tracks my weight, my sleep, my heart-rate - and meshes so seamlessly with my S-Health on my Galaxy S6 that it is so easy to track my results, and thus plan accordingly. I&#39;ve now lost 10 pounds in less than a month, and I pretty much owe it all to this nifty little device and Samsung! Thanks guys!

I received countless compliments daily on the look of my watch. It is the perfect size, shape, and contour to any wrist. It is also extremely durable, it has taken many drops and hits without showing signs of wear. The battery life is phenomenal, it typical last me 3 to 4 days before it requires a charge and I use it constantly. It is quick and easy to access information instead of always looking at my phone, so I can pay attention to what is going on around me and enjoy life.

5 | Works Great, but be patient with old stains | Innkeeper | May 1, 2015
As an innkeeper and mother of five I am constantly battling stains. It is very disheartening to see newly purchased expensive sheets and towels stained beyond saving after only a few days in circulation. I was glad to find Oxi Clean Max Force. I use it for stubborn stains that refuse to disappear after regular wash, pre-soaking with Oxi Clean Powder and manual wash. I first tried it out on a fairly new towel that was doomed to be discarded because after washing, soaking and re-washing the stain was still there. I was especially determined. I just purchased this high quality Egyptian cotton creamy-white towels and the very first week some were covered with yellow-brown stains that would not wash away. I sprayed a good portion of Max Force on, rubbed it in and let it sit for 6 hours. At first there was no change. I kept coming back every day, adding a few sprays onto the stain to keep it soaked and giving it a few rubs. On the seventh day I washed the towel and it was as good as new. I was so impressed I took all the other doomed sheets and towels and patiently gave them the same treatment. This time I kept them in a tub covered with plastic wrap so that Max Force wouldn&#39;t dry up and I would not need to reapply it as much. I saved so many of my precious Egyptian cotton sheets and towels from being thrown away that my time and Max Force&#39;s price are totally worth it. I only wish I could buy it in a larger bottle. I have been so happy with Oxi Clean products in general that I have a positive association with their smells.

1 | Don't waste your money | Mommyof2 | April 12, 2015
I bought this product a few weeks ago and I was horribly disappointed! I have small children who constantly are getting some sort of stain on their little clothes. I treated their clothes with this product (twice) and washed them (twice) and they are still stained!!! Huge waste of money and I will never buy it again. I ended up tossing a lot of shirts because I have been unable to find a product good enough to remove the stains.

Pros: Easy to Clean; Quick Installation; Stores Easily; Lightweight<br><br>Cons: Very Small Steps<br><br>This product was alot smaller than I expected but luckily I have a small dog.  The steps are very narrow but once he got the hang of it he did alright.  It serves the purpose but I would not recommend it for a medium or large dog at all.  Being plastic it cleans easy, folds up for easy storage and there was nothing to put together except the attach the carpet pads to the top of the steps and they were self-adhesive.

I did have a problem like I read in some of the reviews with the little sticker feet coming off. A quick fix with a little drop of E6000. I let it set up over night and WAHLA! They are perfect!<br><br>I also like it that they are easy to wipe down to keep clean and they fold up and slide under my bed or in the closet when I want them out of sight.<br><br>Well worth trying and they are a great price on the Bed, Bath and Beyond site!

Theses steps are very well made and lock easily into position upon unpacking. Even the pads on the steps are well made and easy to put apply. The little non skid nobs are kind of had to see when peeling off. I dropped one and it took awhile to find. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and the price was outstanding. My Maltese took right to these steps and doesn&#39;t have to wake us up from bed when he wants up or down.

4 | Dog Stairs | Mickalow | December 31, 2014
There stairs are very good for the price. I like the fact that they fold up and are light weight. I have a small dog, around 18 lbs, and he doesn&#39;t have any problem using the stairs, but he tends to go up them on the run. I think this is because the steps are not that wide, and he does not feel comfortable going up them one at a time. And, it just may be him, and would not be the same for other dogs.. Over-all, a good valuee.

Bought two of these in gray and black, size XLT. I&#39;m 6&#39;7&quot; 250lbs. Standing with good posture the sleeves end just above my knuckles, which is pretty much perfect. The jackets have room for me to wear an unsulated sweat jacket underneath, which is what I do, but arent to loose to wear alone. After reading some reviews, I see they have added an inside pocket, perfect size for an iphone with case. Other reviews mentioned issues with zippers. They are metal and have worked fine for me so far.

We had to return these pants because they were sized incorrectly. My husband didn&#39;t want to replace them. They were at least 3&quot; to long and the were very baggy. Maybe it had the wrong tag. Levi&#39;s are usually reliable in their sizing. The idea of the pants sounds good with a bit of stretch. Women&#39;s pants have had it for a while now. Men should be comfortable too.

4 | Like the stretch | LeoZ | November 18, 2015
I&#39;m athletically built and I like the fact that they offer these jeans in odd sizes. I was able to get a 33 waist, which is usually hard to find. I really like the stretch material in these jeans and I&#39;ve also bought 505s and 541s with this same material. They fit snug but not tight and the material allows me a comfortable range of motion. The 514s are a little higher in the crotch than the others but they are still comfortable. The 514s are also snugger on my waist than the 505s and the 541s even though they are all waist size 33. I bought the 514s in black and they look great. I&#39;m glad they finally started making mens jeans in this material. I didn&#39;t give excellent ratings because I don&#39;t know how durable these are yet but I love them so far.

5 | Stunning Leather | kodya | December 3, 2015
The leather used on this bag is wonderful. I really like a soft leather as is used in this bag and the black color is lovely and neutral with the gold chain strap. The Mini Convertible Phoebe is bigger than it looks, especially the three inch wide middle compartment. The snap works quickly to secure everything. My concern is that the strap with chain is VERY heavy. It&#39;s actually heavier than the bag. The actual links on the chain are also quite big. I think this may be my preference as I was looking for a small bag and the total weight is more medium because of the chain (my husband agreed on the weight of the chain as I was questioning myself).. All in all, a great Kate Spade look. BTW, the &#39;Kate Spade New York&#39; emblem is so nice - studs instead of stamped. Nordstrom delivery, ordered online Saturday, was on Tuesday!

If you&#39;re looking for a small purse with lots of dividers/pockets, this is it! There is great organization potential but not lots of room so you have to want a small purse. The color is very rich and the style is lovely. It has room for a phone, wallet (7&quot; long), sunglasses, keys, and the extra incidentals like mints, lipstick, gum, etc. but not a big make-up case.

I typically don&#39;t go for smaller handbags, but the interior layout of this one makes it roomier than you might think. The 3 compartment organization along with pockets for your smartphone etc. give it the ability to hold quite a bit. Photos do not do this bag justice, the color and detailing are gorgeous in person. Love the convertible chain and the option to switch from a double chained shoulder bag to a single chain cross body when needed.

Most of the reviews stating that the product is a little loose in some areas are completely correct. There is some extra bunching around the knees. These really are more like pants and you could get away with not wearing another layer on top. Most people don&#39;t realize they are fleece when I wear mine and they are super warm. I like the high waist fit and agree that a draw string would be helpful. If you are handy though, you can install your own.

I ordered these as pants to wear in the house during the winter. They have been great for that --- so warm and comfy.They do stretch out though, which is fine for me cause I&#39;d rather have them be a little loose, but they definitely don&#39;t stay skin tight. I got a small, I&#39;m 5&#39; 5&quot; and 130lb and they fit great. I&#39;ll take these camping once winter is over, and I think they would work great as a nighttime layer as well in that capacity.

3 | Disappointing | MrsGingerAle | January 8, 2016
This sweatshirt is warm, comfy, and good looking, BUT it pilled after I wore it only a couple times, and after I washed it (on the gentle cycle, in a lingerie bag) it pilled even more. Very disappointed.

5 | Great jacket! | Stee_Bo | January 7, 2016
Bought on sale for almost half off! $25.00 later and shipped quickly even during the holidays! My wife had one just like this but different colors. Limited sizes in store but thankfully found plenty online! Very satisfied with product and fast shipment. Also a lot of other similar jackets lacked features my wife liked about her first jacket! Thumb jokes in the sleeves help during colder weather to cover majority of the hand. Others I looked at didn&#39;t have the feature!

I own 2 and this hoodie is extremely soft on the inner fleece and has stayed that way after many washes. I was disappointed that the out side material becomes almost course over time.

I just love this sweater! Not too heavy and not too light. It&#39;s got a really flattering shape, but also looks really cute. Only complaint is that the fabric has started pilling, otherwise, it would be my favorite sweater.

5 | As the name implies- sexy sweatshirt! | Anonymous | January 18, 2014
I bought this sweatshirt almost a year ago and it has yet to see a week without wear. I bought the color in icicle green and it&#39;s a cool heather light green. I love the half zip- I only wish that the zipper went up farther in the neck. What can I say? I like my neck covered. I bought it in the size small and at 5&#39;8&quot; and 130 it was a good choice for me. The sleeves are perfect length (with much adored thumb holes) and it hits just below my hips. I like that because unlike a lot of Patagonia and Prana tops which are too short on me, this one from Lucy is great. After several washings, the sweatshirt shrank minimally, just just enough for a great fit. I wear this hoodie around the house, in town, and for it&#39;s intended purpose, to yoga class and back again. I also have another Lucy yoga top and feel the same about it. Good brand- worth the money, especially on sale! The cotton is soft yet durable. It seems to be double lined, with a tricot inner liner. The kangaroo pocket is clutch!

4 | Nice All-around Sweatshirt | Anonymous | December 19, 2013
I really like this sweatshirt, it&#39;s great for running errands, hiking, or just hanging out at the house. If you layer it with a thermal underneath it keeps you plenty warm. Or just a tank top for the fall, so I like that it is versatile. The only complaint that I have is that after washing and drying, it seemed to shrink up a bit, not too terrible but I liked it better prior to the wash. I would recommend air dying this one.

I had to get this when it went on sale- it&#39;s so pretty and really sparkles! It&#39;s my first Roberto Coin piece and will not be my last. The only reason I docked it a star, is because contrary to what the description and other reviewers said, it does not have an extender on the chain. It&#39;s 16&quot; and that&#39;s it- I had planned to layer this so this threw me off. Going to nordstrom to see what they can do about it... Other than that, I love love it! Don&#39;t hesitate if you love simple but striking everyday/dainty jewelry. Especially for the sale price :)

When I saw this watch I fell in love with it, so I bought it from House of Fraser.. but unfortunately a month later some part of the watch started to go rusty ( No contact with perfume) and because the refund period was over I could not get my money so they gave me gift card at that value!!! after spending so much i did not expect this to happened within a month!! I was so disappointed with my purchase and would Not recommend this watch to anyone!!!

This watch looks great on and great with a tan. It has the gold and silver so I can vary the other jewelry I wear with it. It has the date and glow in the dark hands (if they&#39;ve been in a room to absorb light first). If you walk into a darkened room from a lighted one you can read the watch. Worked great at the theater.

I bought this watch as a xmas gift for my boyfriend&#39;s mom. Decent sized case, not too big and not too small. Considering she does not like the oversized modern &quot;boyfriend&quot; look of watches, this watch&#39;s size was perfect enough to make a statement without being too out there. The rose gold tone is gorgeous and feminine, and the diamond marker is subtle and pretty and stands out beautifully against the shiny mirrored dial!

Great in every way, except one. The latch (the hook part), doesn&#39;t open fully. So hooking it around to put on or trying to get it unlatched isn&#39;t simple and quick. Takes me a few times. That&#39;s the only issue I have w/it. Went back to the counter and that&#39;s how they&#39;re all made.

This product is great beacuse it is similar to my phone with the apps, but fun and safe for her to use.  One thing that I dis like is there is no volume, so if we are out in public the volume is too low and my daughter can not hear it so she will lose interest.

Recommended by both pediatricians and parents, Desitin Maximum Strength Original Paste made this list because of its potent rash-fighting ingredients. Desitin offers the highest concentration of zinc oxide youll find in a diaper cream, which makes it an effective product for even severe diaper rashes. Parents say this is one of the thickest creams on the market. While some parents say this can make it somewhat difficult to apply, most moms say it forms an effective barrier and offers superior protection for babys delicate skin.

I have a Chrysler 300 and it was a bit too wide to fit in the middle but completely covers the other seats.

Pros: Colorful and Fun; Easy to Wash; Easy to Grip<br><br>Cons: Hard Plastic<br><br>My 3 month old enjoys this toy. It is designed to be held easily by small hands. It is the only rattle I found that was the right size for a small hand. In the 2 weeks that we have had it my son has improved his ability to grasp it on his own and shake it. He loves the sound and shakes it a lot. Unfortunately it is very hard plastic so when he gets excited and shakes it he hits himself and cries because it hurts. I wish I could find a soft rattle that he could grab easily and makes loud noise ( wrist rattles are not loud enough to keep his interest).

Only downside it that if you need to wipe it down you have to make sure the cloth isn&#39;t too wet or water gets into the cylinder which is a mold risk.

I bought this for my baby&#39;s room after having a crane elephant humidifier. The crane was harder to clean and seemed to get moldy even with daily emptying. This humidifier is awesome! I can go a couple of days before emptying it and it doesn&#39;t get gross. It is compact and light weight. The only bad part of it being light weight is that you can&#39;t flip the power switch with one hand, which isn&#39;t that big of a deal. I love that I can turn the top of it to have the mist spray two ways to cover more of the room. Would buy again for sure!

3 | Not for oily people | Lindy | January 6, 2016
My first impressions of this primer when wearing it a few times now under my BB cream is that it is very slick. It has a very silicone-y feel to it. I can easily see oily people hating this because of the fact that is goes on super slick. I would image this would feel very greasy on an oily person. I have dry to combo skin and even the slickness of this is almost too much for me. I will say however, that it does a very good job of filling in my pores and creating a very smooth like finish to my face. For the price this is a very decent primer and I am pleasantly surprised with the results.<br>Just be careful because one full pump is far too much for the entire face.

Girls who like shimmer can find several options, as can those who prefer a matte finish to their cheeks. And although the colors may look intense in the package, it is easy to apply them in a way that gives a natural flush. They are long-lasting and never look chalky.

5 | LOVE NARS BLUSHES | foiledd | December 9, 2014
I own about 10 of them and I love every one of them!! Here are some of my faves:<br>&quot;Exhibit A&quot; is easy to over use, but the colour is gorgeous on. One dab and one sweep, bam.<br>&quot;Orgas m&quot; is an award winning classic. The gold shimmer looks good on any skin tone.<br>&quot;Deep Throat&quot; is amazing too! I have a back up of this one just in case!<br>&quot;Se x Fantasy&quot; is very natural looking.<br>&quot;Albatross&quot; is a very nice highlighter to go on the tops of your cheek bones on any of these colours.<br>&quot;Gaiety&quot; is a nice light pink and build able depending on the look you are going for.<br>&quot;Laguna&quot; I got in the Holiday limited edition pack and you get a bigger size in that one than the single ones.

I have pretty pale skin, and I like how this blush doesn&#39;t look overly pink and how it has the right amount of shimmer. Love the look and size of the packaging. My go-to every-day blush.

4 | Nice color, could have better packaging | sourpeaches | October 31, 2015
I too got this for my birthday gift and repurchased as the full size. I love the rikugien color as an every day medium pink, but for the price I was expecting a twist up lipstick like all the other brands have been doing. I did not expect to need to sharpen this product and watch bits of the product get sharpened off.

5 | Great everyday color | CarlyU | August 14, 2015
Goes on smoothly, stays on well, and is a great everyday color. I wear it most days at work and reapply a few times throughout the day. Easy to apply without a mirror because of the slim size.

2 | Love the product, hate having to sharpen | lsands22 | June 29, 2015
I received this product as a sample with my birthday gift from Sephora and fell in love!! So much so that I bought a full size. It goes on smooth and feels wonderful, perfect amount of shimmer and sheerness while still giving me noticeable colour.<br><br>The problem: you have to sharpen the pencil. I was expecting a twist up, especially for $30+ and am extremely disappointed. Having to carry a pencil sharpener and deal with the mess is annoying and inconvenient. I have tried to match the colour in a lipstick by nars...and then by any other manufacturer and have been unable to find something just right...<br><br>Nars - please make these pencils a twist up and not a sharpen.

4 | Would have been 5 Star if full sized | prussia | May 8, 2014
I already own one multiple and I enjoyed the ease of use and convenience of the stick color, but I wanted a matte shade. Finally Nars has released multiples that are matte!<br><br>These are half the size of a normal multiple and the same price. I don&#8217;t like that because there are many color sticks that are far far less costly. Also my package is now fraying around the edges, it is like the matte black packaging is peeling off! (It has only been about 4 months with this) Yakh!!<br><br>I bought the color Anguilla this is described as a ginger pink and I view it as more of a cool toned pink with a hint of orange. I love this as a blush because it is creamy but not so much that it is slippery. It is pigmented enough that you get a nice color payoff and it can&#8217;t be overdone. I enjoy this as a lip product but you need to have moisturized lips to make these work, because they are dry, and will emphasize dry patches. (hence why I do not have a picture that includes it on my lips!)<br><br>I really enjoy the texture of this stick because it is not sticky, greasy or shiny. I am thinking about buying more, but because there are so many options for cheaper color sticks I will have to pass.

4 | Review: Matte Multiple | soleita | August 31, 2014
Bought Altai for cream contouring and I love it!<br>I use a Sephora #75 brush. It remains blendable for a couple of minutes, so you don&#8217;t have to feel too rushed. Wears for about 8 hrs. The texture feels silicone-like, almost velvety, light to medium weight, and smooth.<br>The only drawback is the price and cost of course.

5 | It's great! | CupcakeKitty | May 19, 2014
I got it in Altai and I use it to contour my face along with my Luxor multiple to highlight. It&#39;s very easy to blend with your fingers. Altai looks very natural on my fair/light skin tone&#8212; I wanted to get Vientiane at first but that looks way to orange when I swatched it on my hand in store. (I think Vientiane will look nice on gals with olive/darker skin tones) It lasts around five hours on my normal/combination skin. Only wish it could come in the same size as their original multiples, though.

5 | Really nice product. | VastPyche | January 19, 2016
It was exactly what I was hoping for, but the tounge is attached with the sides near your ankle which is different from most shoes so if your foot is wide or fat like mine itll take a few more seconds to put the shoes on but its possible and is still true to the size I was looking for.

I have two different pairs of nike air huarache and i love them.... But i received these navy camo ones as a gift from a friend and they were ordered online . The pair that was sent were oddly shaped in the front and felt cheaply made compared to the other two pairs of air huarache I own . I guess the only pro is that the color wasnt different than what the pic shows online. i recommend going to purchase these shoes in store .

I purchased this adorable bag in the &quot;port&quot; color because it reminds me so much of the Philip Lim mini Pashli at a fraction of the cost. This is the ideal size for the essentials, wallet, phone, lipstick, brush with a bit of room to spare. The color is a gorgeous wine in person and the leather is deliciously soft while still holding it&#39;s shape. Overall, highly recommend. Seriously considering another color!

5 | Perfect for dry, itchy skin | Veta60 | August 17, 2015
Pros: Easy To Use; Moisturizes; Good Value<br><br>I put this on after my bath and my skin looks and feels great.  I don&#39;t have Eczema, but do have a few areas of mild psoriasis that respond well to a little sun exposure everyday.  But I do find my skin tends to be dry and does itch if I don&#39;t pamper it.  Aveeno products help me do that.  I use their bath oil, shave cream, and this.  I&#39;ve been using their products for a while now and will continue to do so as  the improvement in my skin keeps me from feeling self conscious in an area of the country where flip flops, sleeveless tops, and shorts are your daily wardrobe.  I&#39;m 60 and my skin feels and looks better than it did 10-15 years ago when I was busy with work and just neglected it and wore long sleeves and long pants everyday.  I never though I would be comfortable out in public with sleeveless tops and shorts.  Thanks Aveeno!

5 | BEST MOISTURIZER EVER! | happycamper | May 2, 2015
Pros: Easy To Use; Fragrance free; Gentle; Moisturizes<br><br>Okay, so i never ever do reviews. But this had to be said. For about 2 years now I&#39;ve suffered from moderate to severe acne on my forehead, chin, and nose. Along with that, i have combination skin AND eczema on my face and arms. SMH! It was horrible. I mean red, itchy, bumpy, and everything made it worse. I&#39;ve tried everything over the counter, generic, cheap, expensive, you name the product and I have likely tried it. My doctor supplied me with steroids for my eczema, which helped stop the itching but somehow made me break out more. So long story short, I went online for about 3 days searching for a product that worked for acne and eczema. Now know that what works for me may not work for everyone and also I am not saying this product alone will cure acne. What I am saying is, this moisturizer is simply one of the best to keep your face and body moisturized without being too greasy. My face is smooth and soft and ACNE FREE. Here is what I did.<br><br>In the morning I wash my face with Panoxyl 10% BP (use the 4% if your skin is toooo sensitive). For this I just use a small dime size because alot goes a long way and plus its a foaming wash.<br>I then dry my face with a towel, apply the Aveeno Hydro Cortisone mixed with a dime size of the Aveeno Moisturizing Cream.<br>I repeat this again at night and WALLAH! In a week my face was COMPLETELY clear. I only had one or two pimple scars that I cleared with lemon &amp; tomato juice.<br><br>GET THIS PRODUCT!! for all skin types

5 | BEST ECZEMA TREATMENT OUT THERE | MelissaD | April 22, 2015
I have severe hand eczema and have tried everything. And I mean everything: prescription steroid ointments, Cortisone shot, coconut oil, vaseline, vinegar, etc. Nothing seemed to help. When I read the reviews of this cream, I was still skeptical but decided to give it a try. My first use was last night, and it was awesome. It felt so good when I put it on. It didn&#39;t burn either. When I woke up, my hands felt so good, smooth, and no itching. I put more on once I got to work, and I&#39;m loving this cream. I&#39;m hoping my eczema will go into remission soon. I know it&#39;s because I&#39;m under a lot of stress right now. I paid the same price for this cream as a prescription would have been , but I get a lot more in this cream and don&#39;t have to pay to see a doctor. To be honest, I&#39;d pay a lot more for this cream because it&#39;s that good and better for your body than any prescriptions. So if you&#39;re still skeptical, just give it a try.

If you&#8217;ve tried everything and still haven&#8217;t found your perfect skin care match, Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser may be just the thing you skin care routine has been missing. This gentle product gives you a deep down clean and it&#8217;s also water-based, making it ideal for all skin types. It also contains cetyl alcohol-a palm oil derived alcohol that will not dry out the skin. This substance is actually rich in moisture and helps soften the skin. Use this daily to remove makeup easily.

I had to look again to make sure I hadn&#39;t ordered the lotion by mistake, but no it was the cleanser.  Highly disappointed.  It was like someone had watered it down?

1 | Terrible | Disappointed | June 17, 2015
Cons: Wears Off Easily<br><br>This does not work as a clear coat. I did not use it over other polish, but as a clear coat, it flaked off the next day. It&#39;s very thin, so I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s a great top coat either. Not that shiny (shiny is a great top coat, by the way), and wore off so fast, leaving my nails looking terrible. I thought for the price it was going to be quality, but it was not.

5 | Best top coat | Pink | July 11, 2014
Pros: Good Value; Easy To Apply; High shine; Fast Drying<br><br>Really great top coat. Extremely high shine, similar to getting a gel manicure, without the hassle of trying to get gel nail polish off! The trick is to put on thinner layers. If you pile it on too thick, the top coat will adhere to the colored layers below, and it will make the entire polish easy to peel off (thicker layer, easier to peel off... makes sense). Again, I don&#39;t really have issues with polish shrinkage unless I put too thick of a layer on. Usually, after 5-10 minutes, my polish is dry and I can start using my hands to do regular tasks.

5 | The best! | shopqueen | August 17, 2015
Pros: Easy To Apply; Long Lasting; Good Value<br><br>Seche Vite is the gold standard in top coats. It&#39;s used in every nail salon I&#39;ve ever been to. When I do my own nails I always use this as a top coat. It needs to be used when the nails are still slightly wet with polish. It dries fast, the coat is very shiny, it smooths any imperfections in a manicure and makes a manicure last incredibly long.

4 | Motivates me to move | Moose and Squirrel | September 24, 2015
This replaced my Fitbit Charge (non HR) after its battery died prematurely.<br><br>There&#39;s two reasons to get something like this. One is if you need some motivation to move. I check my steps before lunch and when I get home from work. If the count is low, lunch includes a mile walk or the dogs get an extra long walk after work. The other reason is if you are doing Weight Watchers, and want your activity points automatically calculated. The Charge HR does a much better job with non-walking activities (bike riding, weight lifting) than the Charge or WW&#39;s old tracker did.<br><br>Pros: The fitbit smartphone software is fabulous. I wish every app was this stable and easy to use. The fitbit itself is stylish enough that I can wear it to fancy business things, but rugged enough that I don&#39;t worry about it when I&#39;m active. The alarms are fabulous -- the vibration is enough to get your attention, but not obnoxious enough to disturb others.<br><br>Cons: The Charge HR needs to be worn snugly, which means the clasp sometimes pinches or rubs, causing some irritation. The charging cord is very short, which means the watch is hanging in mid-air if you are charging from a wall outlet. The button on the Charge HR is too easily pressed just by moving your arm (did not have this problem with the Charge) -- this makes the battery life a bit shorter. I get about 3.5 days on a full charge, not the five claimed.<br><br>Summary: I would buy this again in a heartbeat. (Pun intended)

Have tried several &quot;non-slip&quot; mats and this one is the best so far. The surface does scuff up easily compared to other mats, but it&#39;s a minor annoyance.

5 | Awesome Mat | Snuffy01 | December 16, 2015
I love this mat for Hot Yoga. I used to use a thin non slip mat and a towel. This was a pain moving the towel and if the mat got wet I would slip. Also I had little protection as the mat was thin. I sweat allot and this mat takes care of the sweat and I have not slipped yet. (I am a slipper) I was at Hot Yoga and there were about 24 people in the class in a small room and it was really really hot. I was sweating like I had a faucet attached to me. The sweat started to gather on the mat and still I did not slip. The thickness is perfect as it protects my knees. I give this mat an 11 out of 10. The only issue I have is when the mat arrived it was rather scuffed up. This really disappointed me. I took pics and customer service did say they would replace the mat but I did not want to wait the week to ship to them and another week to get another one back. I wanted to keep using the SOL and I could not go back to the other mat even for 2 weeks.

4.2 | Real surround from a giant sound bar | Matthew Moskovciak | March 24, 2015
The Good: The Vizio S5451w-C2 sound bar includes two rear speakers, allowing it to deliver a real surround sound experience from a sound bar system. The sound bar itself is jumbo-size, creating more stereo separation than traditional systems, and the plus-size sub creates more bass. It&#39;s also packed with features, including two HDMI inputs, Bluetooth, and a remote with a built-in display.<br><br>The Bad: Truly massive system, especially compared with other sound bars. The sound bar&#39;s height might block your TV&#39;s remote sensor. And you can get similar surround-sound effects from Vizio&#39;s smaller 5.1 sound bar for half the price.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Vizio S5451W-C2&#39;s extra-large sound bar and surround speakers deliver standout surround sound, if you can live with the size.

VIZIO is definitely headed in the correct direction...at this rate I expect good things. Any ways my favorite thing is the 5.1 with wireless sub...

4 | Rear speakers make this my go to sound bar | gnewengland | April 29, 2015
The rear speakers make this my sound bar of choice. I like that you don&#39;t have to rely on sound reflections to recreate surround sound... As with the majority of sound bar systems, I wish the subwoofer were more substantial. Vizio has several models for this line and this has the largest subwoofer (8&quot; driver) as well as an expanded bar (I believe the drivers are upgraded). Very easy to setup and at $499 ($399 on sale) is still a great value. There are systems with better bars and subwoofers (mostly more expensive) for sure - but none will give you the rear channel.<br><br>Can&#39;t compete with a true 5.1+ setup, but I think this is among the best compromises if you want great sound and surround effects without cluttering up the living room with wires. Adds great depth to the audio of a home theater and makes for a nice, clean, sleek setup!

The sleek design not only looks sharp, but is very convenient as well when carrying it. If I had to say anything about it, is that it doesn&#39;t have a backlit keyboard. This is worth the buy if your looking for a portable, speed demon of a machine.

This is one really good laptop. The price was really good, and I am highly satisfied with it. The battery is awesome, even on wifi. It is fast and has a really good boot up time. I got it for typing, and it does very well, even though I do not have internet at home. Decent amount of apps. Love it!

I bought this chromebook for my sister-in-law who is starting a web based business. She is a busy mom always on the go and this gives her web access and computing power to do business on the go. I was pleased with the service at Office Depot when purchasing this. From what I understand she is pleased with the size, portability, and battery life of this device.

My hubby only gets on FB and his hunting &amp; fishing forums. He wanted something that wasn&#39;t taking up space on his end table but with a screen he could see. Tablets just were too small - this is perfect! He likes the keyboard and screen size is good. So far no problem with battery life - can keep it plugged in if necessary ;) Great buy for what we need it for!

3.2 | Not good, but good for the price if you're a Prime member | Xiomara Blanco | November 12, 2015
The Good: The Amazon Fire tablet definitely isn&#39;t overpriced. It runs a user-friendly operating system and houses a microSD card slot expandable up to 128GB. Amazon Prime members can access the bevy of free TV shows, movies and games included in the subscription.<br><br>The Bad: The design feels cheap. Performance is slow if many apps are open in the background and when downloading. The display has a low resolution and touchscreen response can be sluggish. Gaming performance for large games is slow and the graphics can experience frame rate drops.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Amazon Fire is a fine tablet for casual use, but it&#39;s not a good tablet, it&#39;s just good for the price.

4 | Good entry level tablet! | Applehatersux | December 11, 2015
I read mixed reviews on these tablets and nearly talked myself out of buying one, but then on Black Friday the price hit 35 bucks temporarily, so I bought it.<br><br>I am really happy that I did.<br><br>While it&#39;s no where near that of the Apple devices in overall image quality, it puts out a pretty nice screen view with plenty of color and brightness.<br><br>I was able to download all the main social media apps, several streaming content apps, and plenty of games to mess around with all for free. So far only 1 app has &quot;crashed&quot; on me resulting in a restart.<br><br>The size is perfect, almost fits in a man&#39;s jeans back pocket without a case, but large enough to enjoy looking at for extended periods.<br><br>Battery seems to hold up well, and the buttons are working as they should, with quick transitions and processing.<br><br>I added a 64GB SD card to store things later, but I never planned on using it for much more than an around the house browsing or streaming device.<br><br>The camera works well.<br><br>The sound is decent.<br><br>They make cases just like that of the Apple tablets for as little as 8 bucks.<br><br>Bottom line, it&#39;s not the best tablet, but it is a good one for someone who&#39;s never used one or just wants one for general purpose use. I would trust a device from Amazon a lot quicker then some of these cheaper tablets.<br><br>We bought 4 more to give away at Christmas we liked ours so much.

I got this camera as a gift for my wife and she&#39;s enjoyed it so far. We&#39;ve only had it for a month now, and the only downside we can see is the performance in low light. But for the conditions under which we will be using this camera, it&#39;s the right blend of stylishness, quality and portability.

4 | all the OM-D you need in a small package | Mike Honey | March 12, 2014
This is a proper OM-D camera, cut down in size maybe, but not missing many features.  The wifi and focus peaking are new and very welcome additions.  The image quality is awesome and the autofocus is fast (just like with the previous OM-D models).  There are plenty of m4/3 lenses to choose from...  I am very happy with my purchase!  I can take DSLR-quality pictures with a camera that fits into a jacket pocket.<br><br>The cons are few.  As has no doubt been mentioned before, the menu system is needlessly complicated and is in bad need of an overhaul.  I also wish there was an easier way to set up and recall custom settings - why doesn&#39;t Olympus put C1, C2 on the mode dial like so many other manufacturers?<br><br>Other than that I can whole-heartedly recommend this amazing little camera.  Thanks Olympus for not deliberately crippling it like many other brands would have!

4 | Great camera, not perfect | gumby | February 17, 2015
Pros: Good dynamic range; Fast Focus; Lightweight; Awesome in low light; Responsive; Awesome Low Light<br><br>Cons: Just Slightly Too Small; Shutter Button Touchy; Grip Small For Weight; Grip Small For Lt Weight<br><br>I have 30+yrs of photog experience, starting with Olympus, then a couple Minoltas, then Nikon.  I shot slides when I wasn&#39;t developing and printing my own B&amp;W.  When I moved to digital, it was to a D80.  D80 was nice, but I was disappointed with low-light/long exposure abilities.  I switched to a Canon 50D and loved the pics, but I missed a lot of the nuances Nikon gave.  So I came back with the D750.  In the last couple months it&#39;s been a solid performer.  You can get way more specs and reviews elsewhere, so no point in my doing that... I&#39;ll just talk about my experience in case it helps anyone...<br><br>The camera is great to handle, but could be a bit bigger (not heavier, just bigger like my Canon 50D or the D8x0 or D7x0) - to manipulate controls, I often have to curl my fingers up a little vs. just resting them relaxed on the camera and slide around.  It just feels a little less stable doing that with this camera.  It feels just a tad too small for the weight with the kit 24-200mm lens, like if it was a hair bigger but the same weight, handling would be better.<br><br>Battery life is good.  Nearly no shutter lag.  Front AND rear IR sensors for IR remote.  2 custom setting banks, yeah!!  Ahhh, back to the good old Nikon controls.  FX is good for me b/c I want a wide FOV (landscapes, nature) and other times want shallow DOF (closeup nature).  But don&#39;t let FX hype get you - you might not get as much bang for your buck w/ FX as hype leads you to believe (ie D7100 = nice camera...)<br><br>Grip 1: I wish the AF points were spread more evenly throughout the viewfinder.  I work on tripod a lot and like to bounce the AF/metering point around checking spot metering and sometimes my focus area WITHOUT mucking around with the tripod.  The points are crammed in the middle of the screen adding annoyance to my shooting.  For instance, shooting a sunset from the mountains, as the light is changing, I like to bounce around taking metering from various spots - dark clouds, sun-lit clouds, foreground, edges, etc.  Also, sometimes in such a low-light scene I need a high-contrast area to focus on that&#39;s juuuust outside the AF area.  Sometimes I end up having to unlock ballhead, reposition direction, focus, flip to manual focus, re-compose, re-lock ballhead, and then finally take pic.  What a pain.  Liveview might take care of this issue for focus, but a) Im a dinosaur and like to look through my camera, and b)for longer exposure stuff, I don&#39;t want to burn my batteries up using LV the entire evening.<br><br>Grip 2:  The shutter button is soooo light it a) feels cheap, and b) it&#39;s hard to half-push to set focus/wake it up.  With eve LIGHT gloves on like I use when shooting in the snow, forget about being able to half-push it.<br><br>I like it, it&#39;s a good camera, and is loaded with awesome little features.  But part of me wishes I had gone up to the D8x0 line.  I don&#39;t need that resolution, have a hard time going beyond what the D750 costs, and frankly, the D750 eats up memory cards and HDDs fast enough shooting RAW.  The D750 has all the high-end features/function I want and the images are awesome, so a solid 4 stars.  It just does not FEEL like a high end camera to me.  For $3k kit price, it should feel better.  In some ways my D80 and Canon 50D both &quot;feel&quot; more solid, smooth, and refined which is sad b/c for price and features, should be stepping up.  If the D750 had just a bit better feel and the selectable AF points covered a little more of the frame, I&#39;d jump up and down and give it 5 stars.  Nah, I&#39;d be taking pictures with it right now instead of writing this long of a review...

4 | Great Lens, Questionable Quality Control | sy | September 3, 2012
Pros: Nice Bokeh; Strong Construction<br><br>Cons: Back focus; Focus shift<br><br>When I received my copy, it was a huge disappointment because it had strong back focus from f1.2 out of box. The lens this price range should have better quality control. Anyway I had to micro-adjust forward to -14 in order to focus properly. I&#39;ve read other reviews, and found out that some people had the same problem as I did. I guess it made me feel a little better knowing I&#39;m not the only one. I was aware of focus shift on this lens, and found out to be true. But it&#39;s not too critical for me.<br><br>At f1.2 images are reasonably sharp. It&#39; gets pretty sharp after post production sharpening. It gets sharper when stopped down. It sometimes creates heavy color fringes at f1.2, and it&#39;s more like ghosting. Also auto focus gets wacky at f1.2 time to time but this may be caused by camera&#39;s focus error (5D MkII in my case), or may be combination of both lens and camera.<br><br>In real life shooting, this lens produces fantastic images as I expected. Now the focus is adjusted, I enjoy playing with it. Portraits with wide aperture creates a certain atmosphere. It has very nice creamy bokeh and good color rendering.<br><br>I&#39;ve been using EF 50mm f1.8 Mark I. This is also one of my favorite lens I&#39;ve owned. Noisy (no USM) but very sharp and compact. In fact if you can find a good copy, I highly recommend it. So I had to think if f1.2L worth ten times more money than this little old lens. If you need wider aperture, better bokeh, strong typical L construction, or USM, then yes, probably so. But if you don&#39;t need them, I say probably not. But it surely gives you the satisfaction of owning one.

5 | Excelent lense for specialized usage | Film photography | March 1, 2014
Cons: Heavy<br><br>This is a specialized lense at f/1.2. My review is  for f/1.2, /1.4, /1.6 apertures. This lense is excellent at smaller apertures from f/5.0 to f/13.0 (smallest) but you are carrying a lot of high quality (heavy) L glass if you are only using those ranges. <br>At f/1.2 it shines most in face-to-face close portraiture photography or in creative 3D compositions with the main subject/object at 0.5 meter to 2.2 meter away and everything else out of focus. f/1.2 is not a good choice for scenes with props and objects around people or if you try to tell a story or document a situation or sports (DoF is very narrow, angle not wide, you cannot have more than one center of attention in your composition unless you close it down). The error most people make including myself initially is to think this is a low light lense that will extend their opportunities without changing their style. Once you set aperture to 1.2 it is a completely different animal and it suits a different type of photography.<br>Quality wise it is solid, well build and works perfectly. My only critic is I sometimes get pictures that I thought i nailed that come out slightly out of focus (back focus ? but i have a film camera). Half of those might be my fault as I shoot hand held (another mistake with this lense at 1.2). But I regularly get very sharp ones (although not razor sharp). That would be my only small grip if I had to name one. The value of this L lense is in getting an incredible artistic feel in the picture due to smoooth bouquet especially for facial portraiture where you want to capture mood of a person or appearance under a certain light it is insurpassable. f/1.2 and 50 mmm is a strange combination. It can lead you to make the &quot;wrong&quot; type of pictures that do not work (this has nothing to do with the lense quality but your understanding of the instrument). There is a button on the lense than when held pressed will hold the shutter down to whatever Av setting so you can see the actual DoF focus through the viewfinder ! This is a very useful trick if you are composing in broad daylight. When you get the lense I suggest you play with that before taking pictures so you develop an inner DoF eye for this lense.<br>Again to me this lense is extremely close to a perfect realisation of a 50mm f/2 design except for maybe not being dead-on absolutely razor sharp no question. I hope I situated this lense well for potential buyers as it seems to be a misunderstood spec combination. It is a huge potential for creative photographers and cannot be replaced by anything else in what it can do.

4 | Quality is amazing, but auto-focus slow | Charles F. | October 15, 2013
Pros: Rugged; Nice Bokeh; Strong Construction<br><br>Cons: Heavy; Slow Focus<br><br>I love the images that this lens produces.  The bokeh (blurred background) is incredible and maybe the best I&#39;ve ever seen from anything I&#39;ve used.   The problem however is the slowness of the auto-focus.  My main reason for buying this lens was to great photos of my daughter who is of toddler age.  The problem is that she moves around way too much for me to be able to capture the moments with this lens.<br><br>I sadly could not justify the cost of this lens over the 50mm f1.4 which is only a quarter of the cost.  Perhaps when my daughter (and future kids) get older I&#39;d be able to better utilize the 50 1.2L.

5 | Logitech Extreme 3D Pro Joystick Review: Ranked on Best PC Joystick | Anonymous | June 30, 2015
Pretty much everything about this joystick is designed well and it&#39;s clear that it was created for easy gaming and PC general use. The stick itself is well-built, though it&#39;s obviously meant for a right-handed user. It has twist sensitivity, along with directional control, with a comfortable mold that lets you play longer and control things with great accuracy. The 12 buttons on it should be more than enough for most games, giving you options to program each one with simple commands or complex macros. This makes it easy for you to play with just the joystick, so you don&#39;t need a mouse or keyboard cluttering up your desk. There&#39;s even an 8-way hat switch that&#8217;s great for POV cockpit views and a small throttle controller for flight simulators. Finally, the trigger button is very sensitive, so you can easily fire rapidly or take your time to line up each shot. This is just a great overall device and Logitech covers it with an unbeatable three year warranty.

You just plug and play without having to worry about setting up button mapping (for most games). The lack of a separate throttle is annoying, but non-essential for what I play. Logitech my get a bad rap for their quality on occasion, but there is a sturdy feel to it and it does not come off my desk when I move it around. Overall my only gripe would be that it is not as comfortable for lefties like myself because of the hand grip. Other than that it is a definite buy.

5 | My favorite kitchen tool | Lulu | November 29, 2015
I was hesitant to buy this - would it be too heavy, why is a Dutch oven better than my old pan, is a Le Creuset a better Dutch oven? - but I&#39;m thrilled with the results so far.<br><br>Is this heavy? Yes, it is heavy but not so much that i can&#39;t wash it. I have a traditional cast iron camping Dutch oven and skillet that are twice as heavy and difficult to lift and clean. And the high maintenance and needing to season them was a deterrent in using the cast iron kitchen tools so the enamel lining of this was a big draw also. Nothing sticks and it cleans up so easy!<br><br>I had to pick red - my favorite color - and it is &quot;fun&quot; to use and also pretty when it is out on the counter (it makes me happier when I cook). The durability and versatility of this Dutch oven lets me cook things in the oven or on the stove top; my old pan was only for the stove top. I simmered red sauce in it for 1.5 hours today without any scorching and the clean up was SO EASY. The enamel coat is a dream. i see why this is better than my old sauce pan.<br><br>And is it as good as a Le Creuset? I don&#39;t have a Le Creuset but this Dutch Oven appears to be the virtually the same. When I mentioned my conundrum between the Lodge Dutch Oven and Le Creuset to a local kitchen store, they wanted me to buy their Le Creuset they sold based on the only argument that Le Creuset is French and has a great reputation. Beyond that, I don&#39;t see the difference.<br><br>I recommend this in a heart beat. If I could, I&#39;d buy every color!

The Good: The Gear Fit has a forward-looking design, many more extras than the average fitness band, and the ability to measure heart rate.

And the price is high, so much so that you might consider a cheaper alternative or the same-priced, more full-featured Gear Neo.<br><br>The Bottom Line: The Samsung Gear Fit is a great-looking wearable, but doesn&#39;t successfully reconcile its dual roles as activity tracker and smartwatch.

5 | Fantastic Product! | ScottM49 | November 28, 2015
I&#39;ve been using mobile technology since my very first &quot;bag phone&quot; many many years ago. I&#39;ve used so many different brands - until I came across Samsung with my first Galaxy S2 when it first came out... since then, I&#39;ve remained with Samsung due to their superior products and ease of use. This product is no different. I&#39;ve recently come to a point in my life where I&#39;ve decided I need to get back into shape, but oftentimes the &quot;motivation&quot; isn&#39;t there, or the results are skewed over such a long period of time that it&#39;s hard to really see progress. This has changed with the Gear Fit. With a great price-point, and a beautiful sleek design that is SO LIGHT you hardly even know it&#39;s there! This thing tracks my weight, my sleep, my heart-rate - and meshes so seamlessly with my S-Health on my Galaxy S6 that it is so easy to track my results, and thus plan accordingly. I&#39;ve now lost 10 pounds in less than a month, and I pretty much owe it all to this nifty little device and Samsung! Thanks guys!

I received countless compliments daily on the look of my watch. It is the perfect size, shape, and contour to any wrist. It is also extremely durable, it has taken many drops and hits without showing signs of wear. The battery life is phenomenal, it typical last me 3 to 4 days before it requires a charge and I use it constantly. It is quick and easy to access information instead of always looking at my phone, so I can pay attention to what is going on around me and enjoy life.

5 | Works Great, but be patient with old stains | Innkeeper | May 1, 2015
As an innkeeper and mother of five I am constantly battling stains. It is very disheartening to see newly purchased expensive sheets and towels stained beyond saving after only a few days in circulation. I was glad to find Oxi Clean Max Force. I use it for stubborn stains that refuse to disappear after regular wash, pre-soaking with Oxi Clean Powder and manual wash. I first tried it out on a fairly new towel that was doomed to be discarded because after washing, soaking and re-washing the stain was still there. I was especially determined. I just purchased this high quality Egyptian cotton creamy-white towels and the very first week some were covered with yellow-brown stains that would not wash away. I sprayed a good portion of Max Force on, rubbed it in and let it sit for 6 hours. At first there was no change. I kept coming back every day, adding a few sprays onto the stain to keep it soaked and giving it a few rubs. On the seventh day I washed the towel and it was as good as new. I was so impressed I took all the other doomed sheets and towels and patiently gave them the same treatment. This time I kept them in a tub covered with plastic wrap so that Max Force wouldn&#39;t dry up and I would not need to reapply it as much. I saved so many of my precious Egyptian cotton sheets and towels from being thrown away that my time and Max Force&#39;s price are totally worth it. I only wish I could buy it in a larger bottle. I have been so happy with Oxi Clean products in general that I have a positive association with their smells.

I bought this product a few weeks ago and I was horribly disappointed! I have small children who constantly are getting some sort of stain on their little clothes. I treated their clothes with this product (twice) and washed them (twice) and they are still stained!!! Huge waste of money and I will never buy it again. I ended up tossing a lot of shirts because I have been unable to find a product good enough to remove the stains.

Theses steps are very well made and lock easily into position upon unpacking. Even the pads on the steps are well made and easy to put apply. The little non skid nobs are kind of had to see when peeling off. I dropped one and it took awhile to find. I am extremely pleased with this purchase and the price was outstanding.

There stairs are very good for the price. I like the fact that they fold up and are light weight. I have a small dog, around 18 lbs, and he doesn&#39;t have any problem using the stairs, but he tends to go up them on the run. I think this is because the steps are not that wide, and he does not feel comfortable going up them one at a time. And, it just may be him, and would not be the same for other dogs.. Over-all, a good valuee.

Bought two of these in gray and black, size XLT. I&#39;m 6&#39;7&quot; 250lbs. Standing with good posture the sleeves end just above my knuckles, which is pretty much perfect. The jackets have room for me to wear an unsulated sweat jacket underneath, which is what I do, but arent to loose to wear alone. After reading some reviews, I see they have added an inside pocket, perfect size for an iphone with case. Other reviews mentioned issues with zippers. They are metal and have worked fine for me so far.

We had to return these pants because they were sized incorrectly. My husband didn&#39;t want to replace them. They were at least 3&quot; to long and the were very baggy. Maybe it had the wrong tag. Levi&#39;s are usually reliable in their sizing. The idea of the pants sounds good with a bit of stretch. Women&#39;s pants have had it for a while now. Men should be comfortable too.

I&#39;m athletically built and I like the fact that they offer these jeans in odd sizes. I was able to get a 33 waist, which is usually hard to find. I really like the stretch material in these jeans and I&#39;ve also bought 505s and 541s with this same material. They fit snug but not tight and the material allows me a comfortable range of motion. The 514s are a little higher in the crotch than the others but they are still comfortable. The 514s are also snugger on my waist than the 505s and the 541s even though they are all waist size 33. I bought the 514s in black and they look great. I&#39;m glad they finally started making mens jeans in this material. I didn&#39;t give excellent ratings because I don&#39;t know how durable these are yet but I love them so far.

5 | Stunning Leather | kodya | December 3, 2015
The leather used on this bag is wonderful. I really like a soft leather as is used in this bag and the black color is lovely and neutral with the gold chain strap. The Mini Convertible Phoebe is bigger than it looks, especially the three inch wide middle compartment. The snap works quickly to secure everything. My concern is that the strap with chain is VERY heavy. It&#39;s actually heavier than the bag. The actual links on the chain are also quite big. I think this may be my preference as I was looking for a small bag and the total weight is more medium because of the chain (my husband agreed on the weight of the chain as I was questioning myself).. All in all, a great Kate Spade look. BTW, the &#39;Kate Spade New York&#39; emblem is so nice - studs instead of stamped. Nordstrom delivery, ordered online Saturday, was on Tuesday!

If you&#39;re looking for a small purse with lots of dividers/pockets, this is it! There is great organization potential but not lots of room so you have to want a small purse. The color is very rich and the style is lovely. It has room for a phone, wallet (7&quot; long), sunglasses, keys, and the extra incidentals like mints, lipstick, gum, etc. but not a big make-up case.

I typically don&#39;t go for smaller handbags, but the interior layout of this one makes it roomier than you might think. The 3 compartment organization along with pockets for your smartphone etc. give it the ability to hold quite a bit. Photos do not do this bag justice, the color and detailing are gorgeous in person. Love the convertible chain and the option to switch from a double chained shoulder bag to a single chain cross body when needed.

Most of the reviews stating that the product is a little loose in some areas are completely correct. There is some extra bunching around the knees. These really are more like pants and you could get away with not wearing another layer on top. Most people don&#39;t realize they are fleece when I wear mine and they are super warm. I like the high waist fit and agree that a draw string would be helpful. If you are handy though, you can install your own.

I got a small, I&#39;m 5&#39; 5&quot; and 130lb and they fit great. I&#39;ll take these camping once winter is over, and I think they would work great as a nighttime layer as well in that capacity.

5 | Such a cute sweater | Lindseyf25 | January 11, 2016
I just love this sweater! Not too heavy and not too light. It&#39;s got a really flattering shape, but also looks really cute. Only complaint is that the fabric has started pilling, otherwise, it would be my favorite sweater.

5 | As the name implies- sexy sweatshirt! | Anonymous | January 18, 2014
I bought this sweatshirt almost a year ago and it has yet to see a week without wear. I bought the color in icicle green and it&#39;s a cool heather light green. I love the half zip- I only wish that the zipper went up farther in the neck. What can I say? I like my neck covered. I bought it in the size small and at 5&#39;8&quot; and 130 it was a good choice for me. The sleeves are perfect length (with much adored thumb holes) and it hits just below my hips. I like that because unlike a lot of Patagonia and Prana tops which are too short on me, this one from Lucy is great. After several washings, the sweatshirt shrank minimally, just just enough for a great fit. I wear this hoodie around the house, in town, and for it&#39;s intended purpose, to yoga class and back again. I also have another Lucy yoga top and feel the same about it. Good brand- worth the money, especially on sale! The cotton is soft yet durable. It seems to be double lined, with a tricot inner liner. The kangaroo pocket is clutch!

4 | Nice All-around Sweatshirt | Anonymous | December 19, 2013
I really like this sweatshirt, it&#39;s great for running errands, hiking, or just hanging out at the house. If you layer it with a thermal underneath it keeps you plenty warm. Or just a tank top for the fall, so I like that it is versatile. The only complaint that I have is that after washing and drying, it seemed to shrink up a bit, not too terrible but I liked it better prior to the wash. I would recommend air dying this one.

I had to get this when it went on sale- it&#39;s so pretty and really sparkles! It&#39;s my first Roberto Coin piece and will not be my last. The only reason I docked it a star, is because contrary to what the description and other reviewers said, it does not have an extender on the chain. It&#39;s 16&quot; and that&#39;s it- I had planned to layer this so this threw me off. Going to nordstrom to see what they can do about it... Other than that, I love love it! Don&#39;t hesitate if you love simple but striking everyday/dainty jewelry. Especially for the sale price :)

When I saw this watch I fell in love with it, so I bought it from House of Fraser.. but unfortunately a month later some part of the watch started to go rusty ( No contact with perfume) and because the refund period was over I could not get my money so they gave me gift card at that value!!! after spending so much i did not expect this to happened within a month!! I was so disappointed with my purchase and would Not recommend this watch to anyone!!!

This watch looks great on and great with a tan. It has the gold and silver so I can vary the other jewelry I wear with it. It has the date and glow in the dark hands (if they&#39;ve been in a room to absorb light first). If you walk into a darkened room from a lighted one you can read the watch. Worked great at the theater.

I bought this watch as a xmas gift for my boyfriend&#39;s mom. Decent sized case, not too big and not too small. Considering she does not like the oversized modern &quot;boyfriend&quot; look of watches, this watch&#39;s size was perfect enough to make a statement without being too out there. The rose gold tone is gorgeous and feminine, and the diamond marker is subtle and pretty and stands out beautifully against the shiny mirrored dial!

Great in every way, except one. The latch (the hook part), doesn&#39;t open fully. So hooking it around to put on or trying to get it unlatched isn&#39;t simple and quick. Takes me a few times. That&#39;s the only issue I have w/it. Went back to the counter and that&#39;s how they&#39;re all made.

This product is great beacuse it is similar to my phone with the apps, but fun and safe for her to use.  One thing that I dis like is there is no volume, so if we are out in public the volume is too low and my daughter can not hear it so she will lose interest.

Recommended by both pediatricians and parents, Desitin Maximum Strength Original Paste made this list because of its potent rash-fighting ingredients. Desitin offers the highest concentration of zinc oxide youll find in a diaper cream, which makes it an effective product for even severe diaper rashes. Parents say this is one of the thickest creams on the market. While some parents say this can make it somewhat difficult to apply, most moms say it forms an effective barrier and offers superior protection for babys delicate skin.

Pros: Colorful and Fun; Easy to Wash; Easy to Grip<br><br>Cons: Hard Plastic<br><br>My 3 month old enjoys this toy. It is designed to be held easily by small hands. It is the only rattle I found that was the right size for a small hand. In the 2 weeks that we have had it my son has improved his ability to grasp it on his own and shake it. He loves the sound and shakes it a lot. Unfortunately it is very hard plastic so when he gets excited and shakes it he hits himself and cries because it hurts. I wish I could find a soft rattle that he could grab easily and makes loud noise ( wrist rattles are not loud enough to keep his interest).

Only downside it that if you need to wipe it down you have to make sure the cloth isn&#39;t too wet or water gets into the cylinder which is a mold risk.

I bought this for my baby&#39;s room after having a crane elephant humidifier. The crane was harder to clean and seemed to get moldy even with daily emptying. This humidifier is awesome! I can go a couple of days before emptying it and it doesn&#39;t get gross. It is compact and light weight. The only bad part of it being light weight is that you can&#39;t flip the power switch with one hand, which isn&#39;t that big of a deal. I love that I can turn the top of it to have the mist spray two ways to cover more of the room. Would buy again for sure!

3 | Not for oily people | Lindy | January 6, 2016
My first impressions of this primer when wearing it a few times now under my BB cream is that it is very slick. It has a very silicone-y feel to it. I can easily see oily people hating this because of the fact that is goes on super slick. I would image this would feel very greasy on an oily person. I have dry to combo skin and even the slickness of this is almost too much for me. I will say however, that it does a very good job of filling in my pores and creating a very smooth like finish to my face. For the price this is a very decent primer and I am pleasantly surprised with the results.<br>Just be careful because one full pump is far too much for the entire face.

5 | NARS Powder Blush Review: Ranked on Best Powder Blush | Anonymous | December 17, 2013
With so many options to choose from, anyone can find the perfect color for them. The blushes are perfect for both warm and cool-toned complexions. Girls who like shimmer can find several options, as can those who prefer a matte finish to their cheeks. And although the colors may look intense in the package, it is easy to apply them in a way that gives a natural flush. They are long-lasting and never look chalky.

5 | LOVE NARS BLUSHES | foiledd | December 9, 2014
I own about 10 of them and I love every one of them!! Here are some of my faves:<br>&quot;Exhibit A&quot; is easy to over use, but the colour is gorgeous on. One dab and one sweep, bam.<br>&quot;Orgas m&quot; is an award winning classic. The gold shimmer looks good on any skin tone.<br>&quot;Deep Throat&quot; is amazing too! I have a back up of this one just in case!<br>&quot;Se x Fantasy&quot; is very natural looking.<br>&quot;Albatross&quot; is a very nice highlighter to go on the tops of your cheek bones on any of these colours.<br>&quot;Gaiety&quot; is a nice light pink and build able depending on the look you are going for.<br>&quot;Laguna&quot; I got in the Holiday limited edition pack and you get a bigger size in that one than the single ones.

5 | Nars Orgasm Blush | SmellyCharlie | November 25, 2015
I have pretty pale skin, and I like how this blush doesn&#39;t look overly pink and how it has the right amount of shimmer. Love the look and size of the packaging. My go-to every-day blush.

4 | Nice color, could have better packaging | sourpeaches | October 31, 2015
I too got this for my birthday gift and repurchased as the full size. I love the rikugien color as an every day medium pink, but for the price I was expecting a twist up lipstick like all the other brands have been doing. I did not expect to need to sharpen this product and watch bits of the product get sharpened off.

5 | Great everyday color | CarlyU | August 14, 2015
Goes on smoothly, stays on well, and is a great everyday color. I wear it most days at work and reapply a few times throughout the day. Easy to apply without a mirror because of the slim size.

2 | Love the product, hate having to sharpen | lsands22 | June 29, 2015
I received this product as a sample with my birthday gift from Sephora and fell in love!! So much so that I bought a full size. It goes on smooth and feels wonderful, perfect amount of shimmer and sheerness while still giving me noticeable colour.<br><br>The problem: you have to sharpen the pencil. I was expecting a twist up, especially for $30+ and am extremely disappointed. Having to carry a pencil sharpener and deal with the mess is annoying and inconvenient. I have tried to match the colour in a lipstick by nars...and then by any other manufacturer and have been unable to find something just right...<br><br>Nars - please make these pencils a twist up and not a sharpen.

4 | Would have been 5 Star if full sized | prussia | May 8, 2014
I already own one multiple and I enjoyed the ease of use and convenience of the stick color, but I wanted a matte shade. Finally Nars has released multiples that are matte!<br><br>These are half the size of a normal multiple and the same price. I don&#8217;t like that because there are many color sticks that are far far less costly. Also my package is now fraying around the edges, it is like the matte black packaging is peeling off! (It has only been about 4 months with this) Yakh!!<br><br>I bought the color Anguilla this is described as a ginger pink and I view it as more of a cool toned pink with a hint of orange. I love this as a blush because it is creamy but not so much that it is slippery. It is pigmented enough that you get a nice color payoff and it can&#8217;t be overdone. I enjoy this as a lip product but you need to have moisturized lips to make these work, because they are dry, and will emphasize dry patches. (hence why I do not have a picture that includes it on my lips!)<br><br>I really enjoy the texture of this stick because it is not sticky, greasy or shiny. I am thinking about buying more, but because there are so many options for cheaper color sticks I will have to pass.

4 | Review: Matte Multiple | soleita | August 31, 2014
Bought Altai for cream contouring and I love it!<br>I use a Sephora #75 brush. It remains blendable for a couple of minutes, so you don&#8217;t have to feel too rushed. Wears for about 8 hrs. The texture feels silicone-like, almost velvety, light to medium weight, and smooth.<br>The only drawback is the price and cost of course.

5 | It's great! | CupcakeKitty | May 19, 2014
I got it in Altai and I use it to contour my face along with my Luxor multiple to highlight. It&#39;s very easy to blend with your fingers. Altai looks very natural on my fair/light skin tone&#8212; I wanted to get Vientiane at first but that looks way to orange when I swatched it on my hand in store. (I think Vientiane will look nice on gals with olive/darker skin tones) It lasts around five hours on my normal/combination skin. Only wish it could come in the same size as their original multiples, though.

5 | Really nice product. | VastPyche | January 19, 2016
It was exactly what I was hoping for, but the tounge is attached with the sides near your ankle which is different from most shoes so if your foot is wide or fat like mine itll take a few more seconds to put the shoes on but its possible and is still true to the size I was looking for.

2 | Not very white | shalaynap | January 16, 2016
I love huaraches! They&#39;re comfortable and stylish. I have them in all black. But unfortunately the shoe was not as white as I anticipated. The leather on the shoe looked yellow and the mesh of the shoe looked a bit brown in person.

2 | Nope | valentineK | January 9, 2016
I have two different pairs of nike air huarache and i love them.... But i received these navy camo ones as a gift from a friend and they were ordered online . The pair that was sent were oddly shaped in the front and felt cheaply made compared to the other two pairs of air huarache I own . I guess the only pro is that the color wasnt different than what the pic shows online. i recommend going to purchase these shoes in store .

Good shoe but not great. Im a huarache fan converted from Air Max. This edition missed the mark a little for me on the huarache scale but as a shoe on its own its solid.

4 | Like the original Huaraches | SydnieS943647624 | January 12, 2016
I also bought the original huaraches and they were small. I was foolish to think these were different and ended up exchanging an 11 for a 12. I got the all whites and they look clean and very soft/ comfy

4 | Take a size up | simply23red | January 12, 2016
These shoes run small so make sure you select a size up from what you would normally wear in Nikes. These are great shoes with an aggressive sole for the trailing is you wish.

5 | Perfect Weekend Bag | StunningSophisticate | November 16, 2015
I got one in baby pink/gold and it is perfect for the weekend - the crossbody is a great style for casual strolling around town, the bag fits the off-duty essentials and I love it&#39;s overall &quot;look&quot;. I will for sure be buying another, likely in black.

1 | Color is not what it looks like | bfiwjenny | November 2, 2015
Decided to buy this purse because of the color, described as Pewter. When it arrived, it looks more like gold than silver. Very disappointed. Color is not what it looks like on the website, Pewter is silver not gold.

5 | The perfect bag! | Classic Charm | September 21, 2015
I love the size and color of this mini MAC. The bag can be worn with both jeans and formal attire. I receive comments every time I carry it. A must for your wardrobe as it is both classic and stunning.

Just received this bag today. It&#39;s for my daughter&#39;s 21st birthday. It&#39;s absolutely beautiful. Love the grey with gold accents and it&#39;s the perfect size. As usual, Rebecca Minkoff outdoes herself again!

5 | Perfection | SarahtheShopper | November 24, 2015
I purchased this adorable bag in the &quot;port&quot; color because it reminds me so much of the Philip Lim mini Pashli at a fraction of the cost. This is the ideal size for the essentials, wallet, phone, lipstick, brush with a bit of room to spare. The color is a gorgeous wine in person and the leather is deliciously soft while still holding it&#39;s shape. Overall, highly recommend. Seriously considering another color!
